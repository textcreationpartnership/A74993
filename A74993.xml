            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE following Diſcourſe upon the <hi>NATURE ENDS</hi> and <hi>DIFFERENCE</hi> of the <hi>TWO COVENANTS,</hi> may be well reckon'd the <hi>Opus Palmare</hi> of the Judicious Mr. <hi>WILLIAM ALLEN,</hi> though nothing came from the Pen of that very judicious Writer, which may not be eſteemed among the beſt in its Kind. And even in his Polemick Diſcourſes ſuch was his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and Temper, that every Thing he ſpoke was very convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, but never provoking; ſo that he had the Happineſs which few Controvertiſts enjoyed, that even his Adverſaries wou'd not mention him without Expreſſions of Eſteem. But the Character I had from two moſt Excellent and Learned Biſhops, not many Years ſince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, of the ſubact Judgment of this truly Great Man, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly as it appeared in this Tract of the <hi>TWO COVENANTS,</hi> were ſufficient with me to value with a particular Regard, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever came from him, and This in a more eſpecial Manner.</p>
                  <p>The learned Biſhop <hi>Williams</hi> who had been intimate with him, ſaid of him, That though be was the moſt candid Perſon living, and never heard him paſs harſh Cenſures of Men and their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; yet ſuch was that Awe with Reſpect to him which the greateſt Men in thoſe Times, as well as himſelf, found upon their Spirits, that whenever they gave Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> a Turn at his <hi>Tueſday</hi>'s Lecture at St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> if they ſhould happen to caſt an
<pb facs="tcp:151517:4"/> Eye upon Mr. <hi>ALLEN</hi> in the Congregation, they could not help being under ſome Concern, leſt an Expreſſion ſhould drop out of their Mouths which could not bear the Teſt. And the Reverend Biſhop <hi>LLOYD</hi> being ask'd his Opinion concerning the Reprinting this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the <hi>TWO COVENANTS;</hi> He advis'd it with theſe Words; By all Means: It was that Tract of Mr. <hi>ALLEN</hi> made me a Divine.</p>
                  <p>I never met with the Perſon who did not eaſily allow this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Prelate to be the greateſt Scripturiſt perhaps of any Age. A Man indeed like <hi>Apollos</hi> mighty in the Scriptures. And this Tract of Mr. <hi>ALLEN</hi> is a Key of excellent Uſe to the Opening of them, as it diſcovers in the different Oeconomies and Diſpenſations of the Law and the Goſpel, the Aim of God in both to be the ſame; Namely, the ſelecting to himſelf a Church out of the wicked World, and the tying the ſame in the cloſeſt Bonds of Allegiance to him by Covenant; but yet by ſuch, as tho' different in Appearance and Circumſtances, according to the Difference of Times and Perſons, yet agreeing in the main Deſign of Erecting and Preſerving a Church to God, and the Salvation of Men thro' one Mediator <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And that the Old and New Teſtament are but as diſtinct Editions of the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in Subſtance.</p>
                  <p>The Occaſion of Printing it in <hi>Folio</hi> after a former Edition in <hi>8<hi rend="sup">vo</hi>.</hi> but before all his Works were collected in <hi>folio,</hi> was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix it to the Lectures on the Preliminary Queſtions and Anſwers of the Church Catechiſm, the Subject of the <hi>Baptiſmal Covenant,</hi> to which this of Mr. <hi>ALLEN,</hi> 'twas thought, wou'd be the beſt Introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And that they would moſt naturally cohere together, the one treating upon that great and comprehenſive Subject, the Doctrine of the Covenant in general, the other of the Covenant of Grace into which we Chriſtians are baptiz'd in particular. And both Tracts were bound up together to be beſtow'd into the <hi>Parochial Libraries</hi> then begun, and which God be prais'd ſtill continue to be diſpers'd, ſo far as the Stock of Books will reach, in ſome of the poorer Livings throughout the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The Deſign of theſe <hi>Parochial Libraries</hi> is to ſupply the Miniſters in ſuch mean Cures as will not enable them to furniſh themſelves with Neceſſary Books. To ſupply them, I ſay, with the Means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may be enabled to declare unto the People, both by Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Catechiſing, the whole Syſtem of Chriſtian Doctrine, ſo as to
<pb facs="tcp:151517:4"/> be able with St. <hi>Paul</hi> at their Departure, whether by Death, or Ceſſion, <hi>to call them to Record that they have not ſhunned to declare unto them the whole Counſel of God,</hi> Acts <hi>20, 27.</hi> And as in a Scheme of ſuch Libraries the Books ought to be adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the whole Syſtem, and the ſeveral Parts thereof; ſo they cou'd not be form'd upon a better Plan, it was ſuppos'd, than that of the Two Covenants; and more eſpecially the <hi>Covenant of Grace, or Baptiſmal Covenant;</hi> On the Nature, Terms and Conditions of the ſame, both the Mercies on God's Part, and the Conditions to be perform'd on ours; On the great Mediator and Mediation by which it was obtain'd for us; by what Aſſiſtance and Means we ſhall be enabled to perform it; under what ſacramental Seals we entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; and laſtly, on that Repentance after Breach of Covenant, whereby alone we can be re-inſtated in the Divine Favour.</p>
                  <p>Under theſe Heads is comprehended the whole Syſtem of Saving Doctrine, at leaſt of <hi>Catechetical,</hi> according to that beſt Plan thereof ever exhibited by any Church, Antient or Modern, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And the ſame in a more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd Manner ought to be the Subject of the Concionatory Scheme. But tho' it be infinitely deſireable with Regard to the Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both Miniſter and People, that the former <hi>ſhould not ſhun</hi> both in the Catechetical and Concionatory Method thus to <hi>declare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the whole Counſel of God;</hi> and in thus doing, they will no doubt be judg'd to have duly <hi>fed the Flock of Chriſt which he purchaſed with his Blood, and over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made them Overſeers;</hi> Acts <hi>20, 25.</hi> yet how is it poſſible, humanly ſpeaking, to do this without the Help of Books? And thoſe not a few; as would appear when the ſeveral Articles of Chriſtian Faith neceſſary to be believ'd included in the general Summary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, call'd the Apoſtle's Creed, come to be conſidered; more eſpecially when the vaſt Series and Chain of Duties of the Chriſtian Life neceſſary to be practiſed, ſhall be drawn out into a View of the Particulars. Each of the former requires particular Explanations and Proof, and of the latter particular States of their ſeveral Natures, together with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Application. And as often entire Tracts are written upon the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Points both Doctrinal and Moral: How can it be expected any Miniſter ſhould ſufficiently diſcharge his Duties by thus inſtructing them without the Supplies of ſuch Books written on the ſeveral Subjects both general and particular? No: it is not poſſible out of the mean Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
<pb facs="tcp:151517:5"/> of moſt Pariſhes, ſcarce ſufficient to provide the mere Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Life, he ſhould be capable to buy himſelf ſuch neceſſary Helps! It was for theſe Reaſons thought a great Work of Piety, or Charity to the Souls of Men, not the leaſt wanted in this Nation, where there are more Cures of Souls unprovided of neceſſary Maintenance, than in any Eſtabliſh'd Church perhaps throughout <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> to furniſh as many as poſſible with <hi>Parochial Libraries.</hi> Some of which tho' ſlenderly provided of Books at firſt, may probably in time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come well repleniſh'd. And as ſuch <hi>Parochial Libraries</hi> are form'd in the main Part thereof, the <hi>Didactical,</hi> on the Plan of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Covenant conſider'd both in its general Nature, and its particular Terms, both <hi>Mercies</hi> on God's Part, and <hi>Conditions</hi> to be perform'd on ours; on the Means by which we ſhall be enabled to perform our Covenant Engagement; On the <hi>Seals</hi> of the Covenant; and on Repentance after Breach thereof: And the firſt general Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in ſuch Plan, being the Doctrine of the Two Covenants, on which Subject Mr. <hi>ALLEN</hi> having written ſo judiciouſly in the following Tracts, as not to be omitted in any one Library; and is therefore ſo material an Ingredient in the whole Collection: ſo it was thought not improper here to give ſome Account thereof, and with what View it has been publiſh'd, ſo as to appear Introductory, as it were, to all that follows.</p>
                  <p>As to the Diſcourſe on <hi>Faith</hi> annext to his Diſcourſe on the <hi>Two Covenants;</hi> that alſo has its peculiar Excellency, as coming from the Pen of ſo judicious a Perſon. And being ſo ſtated by him as not to exclude Conditions in the Covenant neceſſary to be perform'd on our Part, in order to our Juſtification through <hi>CHRIST,</hi> is very requiſite to be perus'd in order to the better underſtanding the Covenant it ſelf, and was therefore annex'd by the Author himſelf to his former Diſcourſe on the <hi>Two Covenants.</hi>

In which Reaſonings of his, <hi>there being ſome things hard to be underſtood;</hi> there are others again which probably miſtaking the Apoſtles reaſonings againſt the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Notion of Juſtification by Works, ran into a contrary Extream, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they might be Saved by Faith, without Works; as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, the incredulous <hi>Jews</hi> thought they might be Saved by Works, without Faith. And if many in our days had not run into ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what alike Extream, through a miſunderſtanding alſo of the Apoſtles Writings, labour and pains would not have been ſo neceſſary, as now they are, to rectifie their miſtake, and to prevent it in others. To the end therefore that the plain Truth may the better appear, touching God's Promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> touching the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Apoſtles ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guings about theſe; I ſhall very briefly endeavour theſe ſeven Things.</p>

                     <p>I Shall endeavour to open the Nature and Deſign of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to <hi>Abraham:</hi> Which <hi>Promiſe</hi> is alſo called the <hi>Covenant,</hi> Act. 3.25. Gal. 3.17. In doing of which, theſe eight things will come under conſideration. 1. What the Nature of this Promiſe is in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. 2. What the Deſign of it is. 3. What are the ſpecial Benefits promiſed. 4. What the Extent of it is. 5. The Security given by God for the performance of it. 6. That this Promiſe was Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional. 7.

                           <hi>Of the Nature of it in general.</hi> This Promiſe I take to be of the ſame nature with that, which in the Goſpel is called the New-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. It's true indeed, they greatly differ in the Adminiſtration; the one being but general, implicite, and obſcure; and the other, more particular, expreſs, and perſpicuous. But though in this they differ, yet in their general nature, they agree in one, and are the ſame. For,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:151517:7"/> 1. This Covenant, as delivered to <hi>Abraham,</hi> was <hi>confirmed in Chriſt,</hi> as well as the Goſpel afterwards, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. and that's a Character of the New-Covenant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.28. 2. The Goſpel is ſaid to have been Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Promiſe that was made him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. 3. He was juſtified by Faith; which he could not have been, but by vertue of a New-Covenant: And it was by Faith in the Promiſe made to him by God, by which he was juſtified: Which two things ſuppoſed, it neceſſarily follows, That that Promiſe was of the Nature of the New-Covenant. 4. St. <hi>Paul</hi> argues againſt the erroneous <hi>Jews,</hi> in his Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi> the neceſſity of Evangelical Faith unto Juſtification now under the Goſpel, from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s being juſtified by Faith, and from God's ſetting him forth for a Pattern and Example to all after-Ages, of his juſtifying both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> upon the Condition of Believing. The ſtrength of which arguing ſeems to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon this ſuppoſition; That the Promiſe, by the belief of which <hi>Abraham</hi> was then juſtified; and the Promiſe in the Goſpel, by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of which Men are now juſtified, do both agree, and are one in the general nature of them. And upon theſe grounds, and under this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> I intend to diſcourſe of it.</p>
                        <p>But when I conſider for what reaſon he <hi>that is leaſt in the Kingdom of God,</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>greater than John the Baptiſt,</hi> (though not <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, nor any of the Prophets were greater than he) and when I conſider likewiſe, how ignorant the Apoſtles were for a time, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the neceſſity of the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the many plainer Revelations thereof in the Prophets, than we find <hi>Abraham</hi> had; I cannot, I confeſs, think that <hi>Abraham</hi> had, or could have a diſtinct notion of all that was contained and implied in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as now it is opened and unfolded in the Writings of the New Teſtament, it does appear was wrapt up in it. And therefore, though I think I may well found a Diſcourſe of the New-Covenant, upon the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as it is now explained in the New Teſtament, yet I would not be underſtood to ſuppoſe <hi>Abraham</hi>'s appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion or Faith to have then been commenſurate to the Promiſe, as it is ſo explained.</p>
                        <p>Suppoſing then the Promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> to be the New Covenant it ſelf, in a more imperfect Edition of it than afterward came forth; I ſhall now a little farther conſider what it was, and what the New-Covenant is, and ever hath been, in the general nature of it, ſince it firſt commenced. <hi>And it is a new Law or Covenant, made by way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt the rigour and extremity of the Law of Nature, under which Man was Created.</hi> For the Law of Nature, the Law of God's Creation, as well as his Inſtituted Law in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> being violated, and impoſſible to be kept inviolable by Man in his Lapſed ſtate, by reaſon of his moral Impotency, and the Pravity of his Nature derived from <hi>Adam;</hi> he muſt inevitably have ſunk and periſhed under the Condemnation of it, unleſs there had been a new Law inſtituted to ſupercede the procedure of this Law againſt him, in its natural and proper courſe. If Salvation had been attainable by Man in his Lapſed ſtate, without this remedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Law of Grace, there would have been no need of a New Covenant.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:151517:8"/> 
                           <hi>If there had been a Law given which could have given Life, verily righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould have been by the Law,</hi> Gal. 3 21. But there was no ſuch Law given beſides this New Law. Nor could the Original Law be repealed for the relief of faln Man, it being founded in the nature of God, and the nature of Man, as he was created after God's own Image; and is no more changeable, than the nature of Good and Evil are changeable. And therefore, as I ſaid, there was a neceſſity that Man muſt have Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed under the Condemnation of the Law of his Creation, as the lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Angels did under theirs, unleſs a Law of Indemnity had been Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. But God, whoſe tender Mercies are over all his Works, to the end ſo great and conſiderable a part of his Creation, as Man is, might not be wholly loſt and undone to all Eternity, out of his infinite Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, Mercy, and Love, did conſtitute a New Law or Covenant for Mans Relief, (which well may be called the Covenant of <hi>Grace</hi>) againſt the rigour and extremity of the firſt Law.</p>
                        <p>Which new Law was in ſome degree, though but obſcurely, made known to Man not long after <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, or elſe there would have been no ground for that Faith which we are aſſured was in <hi>Abel, Enoch,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. But it was doubtleſs ſomewhat more fully declared to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> than to any before, and at laſt compleatly eſtabliſhed and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator of it, who was <hi>given for a Covenant to the people.</hi> And this new Law, in the laſt Edition of it under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, is variouſly denominated; being called, the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> the <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> the <hi>Law of Liberty,</hi> the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the <hi>Grace of God,</hi> or <hi>the Word of his Grace.</hi> And ſo we come.</p>

                        <p>To conſider <hi>what the deſign of God was in this New Covenant or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe unto</hi> Abraham. Next to his own Glory, it was to recover the humane Nature from its degenerate ſtate, to a ſtate of Holineſs, to that likeneſs to God in which Man was at the firſt made, and therein and thereby to a ſtate of Happineſs, both which were loſt by the Fall. Holineſs, Love, and Goodneſs, as they were once the Glory and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of Man before he loſt them, ſo are ſtill perfective of his Nature. And therefore it is impoſſible, in the nature of the thing, to recover Man to Happineſs, without recovering his Nature to a conformity to God in theſe; or for Man to be perfectly Happy, whoſe Nature is not perfected in them. Sin is the Diſeaſe and Sickneſs of the Soul; and it's as poſſible for a Sick Man to enjoy the pleaſure of Health, as it is for the ſinful and corrupt Nature of Man, while ſuch, to enjoy the pleaſure, which the humane Nature did naturally enjoy, or was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of enjoying in its Innocency and Purity. But when the Nature of Man is once recovered to perfection in Knowledge, Holineſs, Love, and Goodneſs, it will then be matter of unſpeakable delight to him, to love God, Angels and Men, and to do the will of God in every thing. It is ſo to the holy Angels: And it was ſo to our Bleſſed Saviour, who counted it as his <hi>meat and drink,</hi> to be <hi>doing</hi> the <hi>will of his heavenly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:151517:8"/> Father.</hi> And to what degree the Nature of Man is here in this World reſtored towards its proper perfection, to the ſame degree it is matter of pleaſure and delight to him, to act holily and righteouſly, and to be doing good; <hi>It is joy to the Juſt to do judgment,</hi> Prov. 21.15. It is a pain to a Man to act contrary to the bent and inclination of his Nature, by compulſion, or fear. And therefore unleſs the corrupt Nature of Man were changed, Heaven would not be Heaven to him, in caſe he were there. Thoſe Divine and Heavenly Exerciſes which are there the unſpeakable delight of Saints and Angels, would be his Pain and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as being contrary to his Nature; and the pleaſures of that ſtate, as having not what will ſatisfie the unſatiable luſt of Mans cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature, would not be ſuch to him, but add rather to his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh. For, as it would be a Torment to a Man to be in e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>tremity of Hunger and Thirſt, and to be without Meat and Drink, and all hopes of any to ſatisfie him: So will it be a grievous Torment to the corrupt Nature of Men in another World, to retain their luſts, and the violent cravings of them, and yet to be without all hope of having wherewith to ſatisfie them (which yet is like to be the condition of Men in Hell.) Here Mens unnatural Luſts are not ſuch a Torment to them, becauſe they can make proviſion to ſatisfie them, or live in hopes ſo to do; and in the mean while drown the noiſe of them, by diverſion. But in Hell it will be quite otherwiſe. And therefore it's eaſie to imagine, that the Torment which will ariſe from the corruption of Mens Natures there, will be unſpeakably great, beſides the piercing ſence of the Happineſs they have loſt, and the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable pains which they muſt indure; and therefore, as whoever hath not his Nature renewed in this World, is never like to have it renewed in another; ſo without renewing of it, it is impoſſible he ſhould be happy there. <hi>Except a Man be born again, he cannot ſee the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> Joh. 3.3. That is, he cannot enjoy it, and why? It is not only from God's Decree, or eſtabliſhed Law to the contrary that he cannot, but alſo from the utter incapacity of his Nature, as corrupt. Wherefore, all <hi>the Veſſels of Mercy are</hi> ſuch as God <hi>aforehand prepares unto glory,</hi> Rom. 9.23. They are ſuch as are <hi>made meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light,</hi> Col. 1.12. Such as <hi>God hath wrought for the ſelf ſame thing,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.5. So that, as I ſaid, there is a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the nature of the thing, that if God would deſign the Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Nature of Man to Happineſs, that in order thereto he ſhould deſign a Reſtoration of it to Holineſs, as indeed he hath. <hi>He hath choſen us to Salvation, through Sanctification of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.13. And therefore the end of Chriſt's great undertaking for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Reſtoration of Man, is deſcribed, by his <hi>ſaving his People from their ſins:</hi> By his <hi>redeeming them from all iniquity, and purifying to himſelf a peculiar People zealous of good Works.</hi> By his <hi>waſhing and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying of them, that he might preſent them to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That this was the deſign of God's Promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> appears, in that at the very firſt it was propounded to him by way of Motive, to quit the Idolatry of his Fathers, and the evil Cuſtomes of his Country
<pb facs="tcp:151517:9"/> (for they ſerved other Gods, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.2.) <hi>Get thee out of thy Country, and from thy Kindred, and from thy Father's houſe; and I will make of thee a great Nation, and thou ſhalt be a bleſſing, and in thee ſhall all the Families of the Earth be bleſſed,</hi> Gen. 12.1, 2, 3. In which, God had a farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign than to reform <hi>Abraham</hi> only: His deſign in him, and by him, was to ſet on foot the Reformation of the World, and the recovering the Nations thereof from the dregs of Idolatry into which they were ſunk. And therefore God ſaid unto him, <hi>Thou ſhall be a Bleſſing.</hi> And this he deſigned, not only in giving him a numerous Iſſue, and making them a great Nation, whoſe Education in the Worſhip of the true God was founded in <hi>Abraham,</hi> but alſo in making both him and them eminent Examples of his ſpecial favour in the ſight of the Nations, by which they might ſee how much better it was to ſerve the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> than the Gods of the Nations: And thereby to invite and draw them from their Idolatry, Superſtition and Ungodlineſs, to Worſhip and Serve the true God. And God in promiſing to <hi>Abraham,</hi> both the Meſſias in his Seed, and alſo that he would <hi>bleſs them that ſhould bleſs him, and curſe them that ſhould curſe him, and that his Seed ſhould poſſeſs the gate of his Enemies;</hi> had, it ſhould ſeem, this in deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> to encourage and quicken them to a holy Life, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.72, 73, 74, 75. <hi>To perform the Mercy promiſed to our Fathers, and to remember his holy Covenant: The Oath which he ſware to our Father</hi> Abraham, <hi>that he would grant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us; that we being delivered out of the hands of our Enemies, might ſerve him without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs before him, all the days of our life.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But beſides all this, conſidering that the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> was the New-Covenant as it was then exhibited, (as I have ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) the benefits therein promiſed had a proper tendency in them, to reſtore Man again to a likeneſs to God in the Moral perfections of his Nature. For the <hi>great and precious Promiſes</hi> contained in the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant as ſuch, are given for this very end, <hi>that by them we might be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of a Divine Nature;</hi> the glory whereof, is knowledge, purity and charity, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. And for God by ſuch Promiſe to make overtures unto Man of Love and Good-will, and of deſires of Reconciliation, is the direct way and method of recovering faln Man from a ſtate of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt God, to a mind reconciled to him, to think well of him, to love him, and delight in him. For <hi>we love him, becauſe he firſt loved us,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.19. <hi>And God was in Christ reconciling the world to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> and how? <hi>by not imputing their treſpaſſes to them;</hi> but being willing, upon their repentance and returning to their duty, to forgive them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. God uſeth the ſame way of overcoming Mans enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, which he hath taught us to uſe to overcome Mans enmity againſt us; and that is, by <hi>overcoming their evil with our good,</hi> Rom. 12.21. <hi>David</hi> dealing ſo with <hi>Saul,</hi> though a bitter Enemy, melted him into Tears, and made him cry, <hi>Is this thy voice, my ſon David?</hi> 1 Sam. 24.16. And, <hi>to whom much is forgiven, the ſame Perſon loveth much,</hi> Luke 7. 42, —47. And if God by theſe methods do once recover Mans love to him, he will quickly recover him to his loyalty and duty; of which, Love is the proper Source and Spring. <hi>If a Man love me, he will keep
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:151517:9"/> my Words,</hi> Joh. 14.23. Now that God's Promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain expreſſions of wonderful grace and love, and conſequently, what is moſt apt to beget in Man a love to God again, and all the deſireable effects of it, will appear, if we conſider the ſpecial benefits comprehended in that Promiſe; which is the third thing now to be conſidered.</p>

                        <p>The ſpecial benefits contained in the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> were ſuch as theſe.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It contained <hi>a Promiſe of the Meſſias,</hi> a Promiſe of ſending Chriſt into the World, and that he ſhould come of his Seed: <hi>In thy Seed ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed,</hi> Gen. 12.3. and 18.18. and 22.18. which Seed is Chriſt, as is ſaid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. And in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of ſending Chriſt, were implyed the things he was ſent for, the things by which he ſhould bleſs the World, as his Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and what elſe pertained to his Mediatory Office; becauſe theſe are the things by which the Nations of the Earth became bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in him, which was the thing expreſly promiſed. That ſuch things were implyed in the Promiſe, appears not only by the reaſon of the thing, but alſo from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Teſtimony, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.32, 33. <hi>We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto you glad tidings, how that the Promiſe which was made unto the Fathers, God hath fulfilled the ſame unto us their Children, in that he hath raiſed up Jeſus again.</hi> I do not ſay, that <hi>Abraham,</hi> from a Promiſe that was but ſo generally expreſſed as that was, could apprehend in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular what the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould both do and ſuffer, though they were wrapt up in it. He apprehended ſo much by it in general, that God Would ſend the <hi>Meſſias</hi> into the World, and that he would ſend him upon ſuch terms, as that his coming ſhould be matter of great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to the World. <hi>Abraham</hi> had ſuch a proſpect of this, though at that diſtance, as made him rejoyce and be glad: So ſaith our Saviour himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 8.56. <hi>Your Father</hi> Abraham <hi>rejoyced to ſee my day; and he ſaw it, and was glad.</hi> And the Promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as it was a Promiſe of ſending Chriſt to be the Saviour of the World, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of the greateſt love. <hi>For in this was the love of God manifeſted towards us, becauſe God ſent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the propitiation for our ſins,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.9, 10. A Propitiation for our ſins: That is, one that by his Death hath procured favour, having taken off that ſore diſpleaſure which God by his Law had declared againſt all the tranſgreſſors of it. For the wiſe and juſt God, did not think the Righteouſneſs of his Government; and the Honour and Reputation of his Law, would be ſufficiently ſaved, and his great hatred of Sin ſufficiently manifeſted, without ſome conſiderable ſatisfaction given for the diſhonour done to Him and his Law by Mans Tranſgreſſion. And yet that this might not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted at the hands of the Guilty, in executing the Curſe of the Law on themſelves; he was moſt graciouſly pleaſed to accept of the Sufferings of his own dear Son, inſtead of what the ſinners themſelves were to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:151517:10"/> have undergone. <hi>He hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us,</hi> Gal. 3.13. <hi>Christ ſuffered for ſins, the just for the unjuſt,</hi> or in their ſtead, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. Upon account of which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of Chriſt for us, all the benefits of the Covenant do accrue to Man. Whatever is required of Man by way of condition of his acceptation with God, becomes accepted to that end, upon account of Chriſt's ſuffering. And his Interceſſion in Heaven, through which all our ſincere (though otherwiſe imperfect) performances, become accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, and rewardable by him, is made in the virtue of it. For the whole Covenant itſelf, is founded in the Blood of Chriſt, which he ſhed for the remiſſion of ſins. Therefore it is called <hi>the New Teſtament in his Blood,</hi> Mat. 26.28. And his Blood, <hi>the Blood of the Everlaſting Covenant,</hi> Hebr. 13.20.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It contained a <hi>Promiſe of Juſtification or Remiſſion of ſin through Chriſt, unto all that ſhould ſo believe, as thereupon to repent of their former folly, and become ſincerely obedient for the future.</hi> For that is neceſſarily implyed in the Promiſe of Bleſſedneſs to the Nations in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed; it being impoſſible Men ſhould be Bleſſed without Remiſſion of ſin, which conſiſteth in removing the Curſe of the Law, in remitting the penalty. <hi>Bleſſed is the Man whoſe iniquity is forgiven, and whoſe ſin is covered,</hi> Pſal. 32.1. St. <hi>Paul</hi> acquaints us that this Bleſſing of the New Covenant, was declared to <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Promiſe, Gal. 3.8. <hi>The Scripture foreſeeing that God would justifie the Heathen through Faith, preached the Goſpel before unto Abraham, ſaying, In thee ſhall all Nations be bleſſed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. It contained in it tacitly, <hi>a Promiſe of Divine Aſſistance unto Men in their endeavours to fulfil the condition of the Promiſe.</hi> For God in promiſing Bleſſedneſs to the Nations through <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, therein promiſed all that was abſolutely neceſſary for him to vouchſafe to make them bleſſed, and without which they could not be bleſſed. And if ſo, then he therein implicitly promiſed to aſſiſt the endeavours of Men to perform the condition of the Promiſe, without the aſſiſtance of whoſe Grace they cannot ſavingly Believe, Repent, and Obey. And ſo it ſhould ſeem the Old Teſtament-Church underſtood God's ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſin, as well as his pardoning of ſin, to be comprized in the Promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Mich. 7.19, 20. <hi>He will ſubdue our iniquities; and thou wilt caſt all their ſins into the depths of the Sea: Thou wilt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou haſt ſworn to our Fathers, from the days of old.</hi> And Chriſt his turning Men from their iniquities, which he doth accompliſh by appointing them means, and by aſſiſting them in the uſe of them to that end, is part of the Bleſſing contained in the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and was ſo reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Act 3.25, 26. <hi>Ye are the Children of the Prophets, and of the Covenant which God made with our Fathers, ſaying unto</hi> Abraham, <hi>And in thy ſeed ſhall all the kindreds of the earth be bleſſed. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you firſt God having raiſed up his Son Jeſus Christ, ſent him to bleſs you, in turning every one of you from his iniquities.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. It implicitly, or ſomewhat obſcurely contained in it <hi>a Promiſe of Eternal Life.</hi> I ſay, implicitly; For I do not find that Eternal Life
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:151517:10"/> was expreſly promiſed to <hi>Abraham.</hi> But yet that was expreſly promiſed him, from which the hope of Eternal Life might well be inferred: As firſt, Bleſſedneſs through his Seed, the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> And ſecondly, That God would be a God to him and his Seed. For Bleſſedneſs is a Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that runs parallel with the duration of Man's Immortal Soul. And God's Promiſe of being a God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> carried in it a Promiſe of a Happineſs worthy of God to beſtow, ſuch as Everlaſting Life or Happineſs is. <hi>And therefore he was not aſhamed to be called their God</hi> (meaning <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob) becauſe he had prepared for them a City;</hi> meaning that in ſo doing, he had anſwered that title of relation of being their God, and done like himſelf <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16. And upon theſe and the like Revelations of God's mind to him, <hi>Abraham looked for a City which hath Foundations, whoſe Builder and Maker is God, and a Heavenly Country,</hi> Heb. 11.10, 16. If <hi>Abraham</hi> did but uſe his reaſon about theſe Promiſes, as he did about reconciling God's Promiſe, that in <hi>Iſaac</hi> his Seed ſhould be called, with his command to Sacrifice him, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17, 18, 19.) he might diſcern Eternal Life in them, though but very obſcurely, in compariſon of what is now revealed in the Goſpel, by which <hi>Life and Immortality is brought to light,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.10. But how ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely ſoever a future Happineſs was promis'd to <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet promiſed it was, for which we have the teſtimony of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 3.18. <hi>If the inheritance be of the Law, it is no more of Promiſe: But God gave it to</hi> Abraham <hi>by Promiſe.</hi> He was here proving againſt the Phariſaical <hi>Jews,</hi> and Judaizing Chriſtians, that Juſtification unto Life, was to be had by the Promiſe, and not by the Law; by Faith, and not by Works of the Law; <hi>that the Juſt ſhould live by Faith,</hi> as <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. And therefore by Inheritance here, which he ſaith God gave to <hi>Abraham</hi> by Promiſe, he doubtleſs means Eternal Life, which elſewhere he calls <hi>the Promiſe of eternal Inheritance,</hi> Heb. 9.15.</p>
                        <p>Conſider now, how God carry'd on his deſign of reſtoring Man by the promiſe of thoſe benefits. For if expreſſions of the greateſt Grace and Love in God to Men, is the way to beget in them a love to God again, and in begetting that, to beget all the deſirable effects of Love; (which are no leſs than a ſincere conformity in Man's Nature and Life to the Divine Law) and if the giving of great and precious Promiſes, is the way of recovering Man again to a participation of the Divine Nature, (as I have ſhewed it is) then the Promiſe of God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which was expreſſive of the greateſt Grace and Love, and contained in it Promiſes, than which there are not materially greater, nor more precious, was a wiſe and gracious contrivance of God, to recover Man to a likeneſs to himſelf, wherein the glory and perfection of his Nature did firſt conſiſt.</p>

                        <p>The next thing I have to ſhew, is, <hi>That this Promiſe of God to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, was Conditional.</hi> If the Promiſe of ſending Chriſt was Abſolute, yet the actual collation of the great benefit of Remiſſion of Sin, and Eternal Life by him, was not promiſed but upon condition of Faith and Repentance, as appears by the Scriptures frequent explanation of the general Promiſe. <hi>Abraham believed in the Lord, and it was counted unto him for righteouſneſs,</hi> Gen. 15.6. If <hi>Abraham</hi> had not believed God, he had not been juſtified notwithſtanding the Promiſe. So that this Juſtification depended as well upon his performing the condition of the Promiſe, as upon the Promiſe it ſelf. And when God ſaid to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Walk before me, and be thou upright, and I will make a Covenant with thee,</hi> Gen. 17.1. The Lord made <hi>Abraham</hi>'s upright walking before him, the condition of his keeping, as well as making Covenant with him. Beſides, it is apparent that God made Circumciſion to be the Covenant
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:151517:11"/> to be kept on <hi>Abraham</hi>'s and his Seed's part, as the condition of what God had promiſed on his part, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.4, 7, 10. <hi>As for me, my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is with thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou ſhalt keep my Covenant therefore, thou and thy Seed after thee in their generations.</hi> And <hi>this is the Covenant which ye ſhall keep between me and you, every Man-child among you ſhall be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed.</hi> By which is to be underſtood, not ſo much Circumciſion in the Fleſh, as in the Spirit; as I ſhall ſhew anon.</p>
                        <p>And the truth is, it would not ſuit with God's end and deſign in his Covenant, of reſtoring Man to the rectitude of his Nature (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before) to do it without Man's endeavours in the uſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of his natural faculties, of Underſtanding and Will, as he is a rational Creature and free Agent. For God works that change in Man's nature, deſigned in his New Law or Covenant, not meerly Phyſically, but Morally alſo. 1. By propoſing great and important Truths to his Mind and Underſtanding, and in aſſiſting this natural faculty, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how his happineſs is concerned in that which is propoſed, in caſe it ſhould prove true, and in conſidering likewiſe what reaſon there is to believe that it is true, and in diſcerning the truth of it upon conſideration. And, 2. By propoſing Motives to the Will, to incline it to follow the dictates of the enlightned mind, and by aſſiſting the Will to be governed thereby. So that Man himſelf is not wholly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in this change, or what goes to the making of it; but is ſo far active in it, as to denominate what he doth by God's aſſiſtance, to be his own act. So that the Man is ſaid to Believe, to Repent, to obey, when he doth believe, repent, and Obey: For ſo he is every where in Scripture ſaid to do. God doth not repent in Man, but Man repents through his grace and aſſiſtance. And therefore God's grace, and Man's endeavours in working this change are very con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>nce of God's Grace and good Spirit? The Co-operation of God's grace with Man's endeavours, in this change in the nature of Man, which is neceſſary to his Salvation, is a Doctrine that lies very fair and plain in the Scriptures. And therefore Men are called upon to <hi>make themſelves new hearts,</hi> Ezek. 18.31. <hi>Make you a new Heart, and a new Spirit, for why will ye dye, O houſe of Iſrael?</hi> And God is ſaid to make them new hearts alſo, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>A new heart alſo will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you.</hi> Men are called upon <hi>to circumciſe their own hearts,</hi> Deut. 10.16. And God is ſaid to circumciſe the heart, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. Men are required <hi>to cleanſe themſelves from all filthineſs of the fleſh and Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. And they are alſo ſaid to be <hi>waſhed and ſanctified by the Spirit of God,</hi>
                           <pb n="12" facs="tcp:151517:12"/> 1 Cor. 6.11. Men are commanded to repent, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. And God is ſaid <hi>to give them repentance,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.35. Acts 5.31. It is by reaſon of this Co-operation of God's aſſiſtance, and Man's endeavours, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth himſelf as he doth once and again, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt; nevertheleſs I live; yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. <hi>I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me</hi> He doth not by theſe laſt words ſo deny what he had ſaid in the former, as if he had not ſpoke true, for he ſpeaks the ſame things in effect in another place, without any ſuch correcting himſelf, as here he uſeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. <hi>For we are la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers together with God.</hi> And therefore by his ſo correcting himſelf, ſaying, Not I, but the Grace of God which was with me, he only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to magnifie God's Grace, as having the principal ſtroke in the work. It is a phraſe of like import with that, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10. For <hi>even that which was made glorious, had no glory in this reſpect, by reaſon of the glory that excelleth.</hi> So Man's endeavour though it be ſomewhat in it ſelf conſidered, yet comparatively, and in reſpect of the work of God's Grace by his Spirit which excels it is nothing. Therefore, in fine, as Men are ſaid <hi>through the Spirit to mortifie the deeds of the Body,</hi> Rom. 8.13. So they may be ſaid through the ſame Spirit, to Believe, Repent, Obey; that is, through the aſſiſtance of the Spirit, who is ſaid to help our Infirmities, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.</p>
                        <p>Conſidering then that there is promiſe of divine aſſiſtance to Man uſing his endeavours in doing what he may, and can do towards the performing the condition of the Covenant, we may well conclude, that there is no Man under the Goſpel doth periſh, but through his own fault and neglect. It is true, God doth ſometimes for ſpecial rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons meet with, and convert ſinners with a high hand of Grace, whilſt they are purſuing their ſins in a full career, and uſing no endeavours at all towards their own Salvation, as he did <hi>Saul</hi> before he was <hi>Paul.</hi> But ſuch extraordinary inſtances are no Rules to us, by which to judge of God's ordinary proceedings in converting Men: Nor hath the Lord put Men in expectation, by any promiſe of his, of their being converted after that manner, and upon ſuch terms. And therefore it will in no wiſe be ſafe for any Man to expect to be converted by ſuch extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary workings of Grace, and to neglect to do what he can do, and what God requires he ſhould do, towards his own converſion.</p>
                        <p>There are many things which Men may, and can believe, and do, without any Supernatural Grace, and by vertue of God's common Grace. It is no Supernatural Act to believe the Being of God, and the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the Soul, or future ſtate: Or to know that we are ſinners againſt God, and conſequently that we ſtand in need of his Mercy: Nor is it a Supernatural Act for a Man to deſire the future happineſs of his own Nature or Being; or to hear the Word of God, which directs the way to that happineſs; no more than it is to hear any other Doctrine, that only pretends to do ſo. Nor is it a Supernatural Act to conſider the Doctrine of the Scriptures with as much ſeriouſneſs, as Men do, or may, the contents of any other Books. Nor is it a Supernatural Act to conſider how we are concerned in the Doctrine of the Scriptures, in caſe it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:151517:12"/> ſhould prove true: No more is it a Supernatural Act ſeriouſly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſtrength and force of thoſe Reaſons that tend to perſwade Men to believe that Doctrine to be true: Nor, under the natural deſires which Men have to be happy in another world, is it a Supernatural Act for them to pray to God to direct and aſſiſt them in the uſe of means, that they may be happy. Theſe I take to be no Supernatural Acts in Men. For though the depraved VVill of Man needs Special or Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Grace to do theſe ſo ſeriouſly and effectually, as is needful to true Sanctification, yet in ſome ſort and meaſure they may be done by common help. And if Men would but go thus far (as they can) out of a real deſire to be happy, I ſhould make no queſtion but that the Spirit of God would yield them his aſſiſtance to carry them quite through in the Work of Converſion. And whither our Saviour doth not by the Hearers, reſembled by the good Ground, mean ſuch Men as before their Converſion have ſome ſuch Working of Heart about their future ſtate, as doth incline them to hear and conſider what with any fair probability may be ſaid about the way to be happy in that ſtate, and not to hear out of Curioſity, or for faſhion-ſake, or to carp, I ſubmit to conſideration.</p>
                        <p>It is doubtleſs then Mens Inconſideration, Careleſsneſs and Negligence in thoſe things which they do Believe, and which they can do, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does them. It is <hi>becauſe ſeeing, they ſee not, and hearing, they hear not;</hi> which is the reaſon <hi>why more is not given, but rather that taken away from them which they had.</hi> That is, The reaſon why God with-holds his ſpecial Grace, and many times with draws common Grace and Aſſiſtance from Men, is, becauſe though they have underſtanding and conſidering Faculties, which they could (if they would) uſe and imploy about their being happy in another World, as well as they do about their happineſs in this, yet they will not, though they are frequently called upon, and excited thereto: Whereas, thoſe that <hi>take heed</hi> or <hi>conſider what they hear,</hi> and how they are concerned in it; <hi>to them more ſhall be given:</hi> God will come into ſuch with Supernatural Aid, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.24. And therefore God, to put Men upon a holy neceſſity of complying with his Grace, in acting diligently towards the working out their own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, hath wiſely made the obtaining of the great Benefits of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Remiſſion of Sin, and Eternal Life, Conditional; ſo that Men can have no farther aſſurance of pardon of Sin, and Salvation, than they are ſure they ſincerely endeavour to perform the condition on their part, upon which they are promiſed. Wherefore, we are greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to be awakened by ſuch Sayings as theſe; <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate: So run, that ye may obtain: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe all diligence to make your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and election ſure: Work out your Salvation with fear and trembling: Let us therefore fear, leſt a promiſe being left us of entring into his Reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it.</hi>

                        <p>I come now in the next place to ſhew, <hi>What the condition of the Promiſe to Abraham was.</hi> In ſhort it was a <hi>practical Faith.</hi> And under this Head,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:151517:13"/> I ſhall endeavour, 1. To give ſome account of the nature of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith in general. 2. To deſcribe Faith. And, 3. To ſhew reaſon, why Faith is made the condition of the Covenant.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The condition of the Promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> was <hi>Faith,</hi> and (as I ſhall after ſhew) a <hi>practical Faith.</hi> For that was it upon which the great Bleſſing of the Covenant, Juſtification, was conferred upon him, with the conſequent benefits. In <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.6. it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in the Lord, and he counted it to him for righteouſneſs.</hi> But St. <hi>Paul</hi> reciting this Scripture, faith, <hi>Abraham believed God,</hi> and it was counted to him for Righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.6. If there be any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between believing God, and believing in God, it ſeems to be this. To believe God, is to believe him upon his Word, to believe all that to be true, which he ſaith when he hath once ſpoken it. But to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God, is firſt, to believe him to be ſuch an One, of ſuch a Nature, as neither will, nor can at any time ſpeak any thing but what is true: It is to believe him to be <hi>a God that cannot lye.</hi> For all true Faith, as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s was, is founded in the Nature of God. <hi>Abraham</hi> did primarily believe in God, and conſequently believed his Sayings, of what nature ſoever they were. And, ſecondly, To believe in God, is to believe that he can, and will perform whatever he promiſed, how unlikely ſoever the thing in its own nature otherwiſe be. And this was the nature of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, as appears by St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Comment upon it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20, 21. <hi>He ſtaggered not at the Promiſe of God through unbelief, but was ſtrong in Faith, giving glory to God: and being fully perſwaded, that what he had promiſed, he was able alſo to perform.</hi> He gave to God the glory of his Nature and Being, of his Truth and Faithfulneſs in his Promiſes, and of his Power and Ability to perform what he had promiſed, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding its utmoſt improbability in Nature. And <hi>therefore,</hi> or for this reaſon, <hi>his Faith was imputed to him for righteouſneſs,</hi> as we are told in <hi>ver.</hi> 22. of <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. And ſo it ſhould ſeem it is not the believing of any one particular or ſingle Promiſe, that is counted for Righteouſneſs, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than as it is an inſtance of Faith in God in general, in reference to whatever he doth ſay, or ſhall declare. Which may be the reaſon why Faith is ſaid to be counted to <hi>Abraham</hi> for Righteouſneſs, as well when he had not the <hi>Meſſias</hi> in the Promiſe as the immediate Object of his Faith, but ſomewhat elſe, as when he had. The Promiſe, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving of which was counted to <hi>Abraham</hi> for righteouſneſs, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.6. was a Promiſe of a numerous Iſſue, <hi>[So ſhall thy Seed be] viz.</hi> as numberleſs as the Stars. But that which produced a Belief of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Promiſe, would, and doubtleſs did, produce in him a belief of the promiſe of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> and of every other Promiſe and Word of God, and declaration of his mind, ſo far as underſtood by him, and that was an habitual belief of God's Truth, and Faithfulneſs, Wiſdom, Power and Goodneſs; his fixed belief in God. And ſo a believing God's Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, ſo as to uſe means to eſcape them, is (it ſhould ſeem) counted to one for Righteouſneſs, as well as the belief of the Promiſes, as growing upon the ſame Root. Thus <hi>Noah</hi>'s Believing God's threatning to bring a Deluge upon the World, and his Obedience to God's Command, in the preparing an Ark for the ſaving of his Houſe, was that, or at leaſt one
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:151517:13"/> inſtance of that Faith, <hi>by which he became Heir of the Righteouſneſs which is by Faith,</hi> Heb. 11.7. It was this general Faith in God that made <hi>Abraham</hi> ſo compliant with every intimation of his will and pleaſure. By it he forſook his own Country and Kindred at God's command, to go he knew not whither, but depended on God's after-direction in that caſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.8. By it he was ready to offer his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> in whom the Promiſes were made: And he had ſuch a firm Belief in God's Promiſe, That in <hi>Iſaac</hi> his Seed ſhould be called, that he concluded that God would raiſe him from the Dead, when he had Sacrificed him, rather than fail in the leaſt of making good his Promiſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17, 18, 19. He had ſuch a confidence in God; that is to ſay, in his Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Truth, and Power, as wrought him to an entire Reſignation of himſelf to God's will and pleaſure. He believed God to be ſo Good and ſo Wiſe, as not to put him upon any thing, but what ſhould be for his good in the iſſue: And ſo True and Powerful, as to promiſe nothing but, what he could, and would perform. In a word; this his Belief in God, made him believe all his Promiſes, and obey all his Precepts.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Come we next to ſome <hi>deſcription</hi> of that <hi>Faith,</hi> which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Promiſe, or Covenant of Salvation: Wherein I ſhall have reſpect to the nature of Saving Faith in general, in reference to all Ages of the Church, and alſo to the Chriſtian Evangelical Faith in ſpecial. Faith, ſtrictly taken, is an aſſent unto the truth of any Propoſition, upon the credit of the Speaker. But Saving Faith is of a more comprehenſive nature, than is a meer aſſent unto the Truth of any one Propoſition. And although Saving Faith is ſometimes deſcribed by an aſſenting to the truth of one ſingle Propoſition, yet then it implies the belief of many more, and ſuch a belief as draws in the Will to act according to the import and concernment of the thing believed. As for inſtance: The Belief of this Propoſition <hi>[That Chriſt Jeſus is the Son of God]</hi> by which, Faith is ſometimes deſcribed, doth include in it a belief of the truth of his whole Doctrine, both concerning God's Grace, and Man's Duty, and the Will's concurrence, as to its concernment in it. For, if he be the Son of God, then he cannot lye or deceive in any thing he hath ſaid. And again, the belief of this Propoſition <hi>[That God raiſed Chriſt from the Dead]</hi> by which Faith is alſo deſcribed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. includes in it a belief, That all that Doctrine which he taught, is undoubtedly true: For if it had not, God would never have wrought ſuch a Miracle, as to Raiſe Chriſt from the Dead, to confirm it. The belief then of ſuch ſingle Propoſitions, include a belief of the whole Doctrine of the Goſpel, which is the proper Object of the Chriſtian Faith, and for that cauſe is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſtiled <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>the Faith,</hi> in the New Teſtament.</p>
                        <p>But if we reſpect the nature of Faith in general, as anſwering the different degrees of God's Revelation of his Will in ſeveral Ages of the World, both under the Goſpel, and before; I do not know how bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to define it, than thus: Faith is ſuch a hearty belief of God's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, concerning his own Grace, and Man's Duty, as doth effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually cauſe a Man to expect from God, and to act in a way of ſincere Obedience, according to the Tenour and Import of ſuch a Declaration. Or, if you will take in the Belief of God's Threatnings againſt ſinners
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:151517:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> into the definition; then it will be thus: Faith is ſuch a hearty belief of God's Declaration concerning his own Grace and Diſpleaſure, and Man's Duty, as doth effectually cauſe a Man to expect from God, and to act in a way of ſincere Obedience, according to the Tenour and Import of ſuch a Declaration. Faith thus defined, we have already ſeen exemplified in <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is the great Exemplar of Believing, and the Father of Believers. And that it was his belief of God's Promiſe, or Declaration of Grace and Favour to him, as it is practical in produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Repentance, Self-denial, and ſincear Obedience, by which he was juſtified and made happy, appears farther, not only in that it's ſaid by St. <hi>James,</hi> That his Faith wrought with his Works, and was made perfect by them, and that he was juſtified by Works, as well as by Faith, (of which more anon) but alſo in that it's ſaid, that <hi>he received the ſign of Circumciſion</hi> (which was the Condition upon which God Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him to be his God, and upon the ſame terms to be the God of his Seed) <hi>a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of the Faith which he had, while he was yet uncircumciſed.</hi> For ſuppoſing (which is not denied) Circumciſion to be an outward Sign of inward Grace, of the Circumciſion of the Heart, conſiſting in Mortification, or a Penitential change of the Heart, which is the effect of Faith, his Circumciſion, as ſuch, was a Seal of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that it was upon his former ſo believing God upon his Promiſe, as thereby to be induced to leave the evil Cuſtoms of his Country, and his Country it ſelf, with his Kindred, and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Houſe; that God would be his God indeed: In which Promiſe was implicitly promiſed, all that would make him Eternally Happy. And God's farther deſign of giving to <hi>Abraham</hi> this Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumiſion, as a Seal to aſſure him the enjoyment of the benefit wrapt up in that Promiſe upon the terms aforeſaid, was, that he might be the Father of all them that Believe, whether literally Circumciſed, or not; that is, that he might be a great Example and Pattern to all others, of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the ſame benefits, in the ſame way; and ſo might be a means of begetting others to Believe in God, and to Obey him, as he had done; to be a great Inſtrument to propagate the kind of New Creatures, of Men renewed to God, to the end they might be Bleſſed, as he was. This, or ſomewhat to this effect, is doubtleſs the meaning of <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11, 12. <hi>And he received the ſign of Circumciſion, a Seal of the Rightouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Faith which he had, being yet uncircumciſed: That he might be the Father of all them that Believe, though they be not circumciſed; that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs might be imputed to them alſo: And the Father of Circumciſion to them who are not of the Circumciſion only, but alſo walk in the ſteps of that Faith of our Father Abraham, which he had, being yet uncircumciſed;</hi> and it is not unlikely, but that as Heart-Circumciſion, under the figure of Literal-Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, was, together with Faith, made the condition of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant then; ſo Spiritual Baptiſm, which is a Death unto ſin, and a living unto God, is under the Figure of Water-Baptiſm, joyned with Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, as the condition of the Promiſe of Salvation, now. <hi>Mark,</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> According to which St. <hi>Peter</hi> having ſpoken of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark, ſaith, <hi>The like figure whereunto Baptiſm now ſaveth us; not the putting away of the filth of the fleſh, but the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:151517:14"/> anſwer of a good conſcience towards God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. Now, as it was in <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſuch a belief of God's Declaration of Grace and Favour, as did effectually induce him to Love and Obey God, by which he was Juſtified, ſo (I ſhall ſhew afterwards) it was the very ſame kind of Faith, working after the ſame manner, by which the Saints, under the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> were Saved.</p>
                        <p>But Faith, as Evangelical and Chriſtian, is ſuch a hearty aſſent and conſent unto God's Declaration in the Goſpel by his Son, concerning Chriſt himſelf, and his Grace and Favour towards Men by him, and concerning their own Duty, as cauſeth a Man to expect from God, and to act in a way of duty, according to the Tenour of ſuch a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his own concerns in it. And Faith, thus defined, is fully agreeable to the Tenour of the Goſpel: <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. <hi>Go ye into all the world, and Preach the Goſpel to every Creature: He that Believeth, and is Baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> He that believeth What? Why, he that believeth that Goſpel which was to be Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>hed to every Creature. Which Goſpel contains a Declaration of God's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

                           </gap>e, and Man's Duty, and of his Wrath againſt all Ungodlineſs and Unrighteouſneſs of Men. For, 1. It declares from God that he hath given his Son Jeſus Chriſt to be the Saviour of the World, by being a Propitiation for the ſin o fit, in becoming a Sacrifice to expiate ſin. 2. It declares, That God, upon account of his Son's giving himſelf a Ranſom for all, hath made, and doth eſtabliſh a New Covenant with the World, to Pardon, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to Save as many as ſhall Believe in his Son, and Repent of their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, in changing their Minds, and reforming their Lives, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming New Men, in yielding ſincere Obedience to the Precepts of the Goſpel. 3. It declares, That <hi>thoſe that believe not, ſhall be damned;</hi> and ſuch as repent not, ſhall periſh; and that the unrighteous ſhall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom of God. This ſummarily is that which the Goſpel declares concerning God's Grace and Diſpleaſure, and Man's Duty.</p>
                        <p>Now it is the practical belief of all this, that is the ſaving Faith. It is not the bare belief that God hath given his Son to be the Saviour of the World, and a Propitiation for the ſin of it: Nor is it a bare belief that he will for Chriſt's ſake pardon and ſave as many as truly Repent and amend their lives, and become New Creatures; unleſs they ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all this, as ſeriouſly and heartily to Repent themſelves of their former folly, and to return to their duty in new Evangelical Obedience. For otherwiſe, for a Man barely to believe all this, and not act according to his own concerns in it, will be ſo far from being a believing to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Soul, as that it will rather plunge him the deeper in Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for living and acting contrary to his own light and belief, as <hi>holding the truth in unrighteouſneſs; the wrath of God being revealed from heaven againſt all ſuch,</hi> Rom. 1.18.</p>
                        <p>A Man of this practical Faith which I have deſcribed, eyes as well the condition upon which the ſaving Benefits are promiſed through Chriſt, as the Promiſe it ſelf of thoſe benefits; and expects the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe benefits upon God's Promiſe and Chriſt's Purchaſe, no otherwiſe, than as he, with the aſſiſtance of God's Grace, is careful to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Condition. Which belief of his, makes him as careful to perform the Condition in diſcharge of his own duty therein, as ever he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:151517:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> hopes to enjoy the promiſed Pardon and Salvation by Chriſt, and to eſcape the Damnation threatned againſt thoſe who perform not the condition. So that a Man by this practical Faith, belives one part of God's Declaration in the Goſpel, as well as the other; and his own duty to be as well neceſſary to his Juſtification, as the condition appointed by God, as the Grace of God, through Chriſt, it ſelf, is upon another account: And by this belief, he is effectually moved, as well to act in a way of duty to God, as to expect mercy from him; conſidering how his Happineſs is concerned in both, when he hath the whole of God's Declaration in all the parts taken together, in proſpect, as the Object of his Faith.</p>
                        <p>When he hears, that <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, that whoſoever believes in him, ſhould not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</hi> When he hears, that <hi>God hath ſet forth Chriſt to be a Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through Faith in his Blood:</hi> And when he hears again, that <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the World unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them;</hi> he believes all this to be true, as coming from God that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lye; and accordingly, is incouraged to hope in God's Mercy, and is comforted thereby. But then when he hears again, that <hi>except we repent, we ſhall all periſh;</hi> that <hi>except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God:</hi> That <hi>without holineſs, no man ſhall ſee the Lord;</hi> and that <hi>the pure in heart ſhall ſee God:</hi> That <hi>not every one that ſaith Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth the will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven:</hi> That <hi>the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angles in flaming fire, to render vengeance to all thoſe that know not God, and which obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> But that <hi>he is the Author of eternal Salvation to all thoſe that obey him.</hi> I ſay, when he hears all this, he as verily believes this part of God's Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Goſpel, to be the faithful and true Sayings of God, as he acounted the other to be. And accordingly, doth as ſeriouſly, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely ſet upon the Work of Repentance, and as carefully uſeth God's appointed means for the changing of his Heart, and renewing of his Nature, for <hi>the purifying of himſelf, as God is pure;</hi> and doth as carefully obey all the Precepts of the Goſpel; as he hopes upon the account of Chriſt's Sufferings, and God's Promiſe, to be Pardoned and Saved; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living that thoſe Benefits are neither promiſed, nor can be obtained, but in this way of performing the Condition. And I doubt not to ſay, that this practical Faith, as it reſpects God's Declaration, touching Man's duty, in conjunction with his own Grace in Chriſt, is, where the Goſpel comes, the only ſaving juſtifying Faith.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Come we now to ſhew Reaſon, why Faith is made the Condition of the Promiſe.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>It is of Faith, that it might be of Grace,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. It is that the Grace of God to miſerable Men, might the more ſhew it ſelf. For ſo it doth, not only in promiſing unſpeakably great things through Chriſt to Man, who is not only undeſerving, but illdeſerving alſo; but alſo, in that theſe are promiſed upon ſuch a poſſible, practical, eaſie Condition as Faith is, conſidering the means and aſſiſtance promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by God to work it: And conſidering alſo, that the Promiſe is made
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:151517:15"/> to the truth, unfeignedneſs and ſincerity, and not to perfection of Faith, Repentance, and new Obedience, in their utmoſt degree. So that Chriſt might well ſay, <hi>my Yoke is eaſie, and my Burden light,</hi> Matth. 11.30. Whereas the old way of promiſing the Inheritance on the Law-terms, would have been to have promiſed it upon impoſſible conditions, as the caſe now is with fallen Man. And if God ſhould have promiſed never ſo great things to Man, in his impotent and miſerable ſtate, upon an impoſſible condition, he would have been ſo far from manifeſting abundance of Grace, Compaſſion, and Love to him in that condition, as that he would rather have ſeemed to inſult over him in it. And therefore, if the Promiſe ſhould have run upon the Law-terms, and not of Faith, it would utterly have fruſtrated God's deſign of manifeſting his Grace to Man, and of recovering Man's Love and Loyalty to him thereby. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.14. <hi>If they which are of the Law be Heirs, Faith is made void, and the Promiſe made of none effect. But it is of Faith, that it might be by Grace, to the end the Promiſe might be ſure to all the Seed, not to that only which is of the Law, but to that alſo which is of the Faith of Abraham,</hi> ver. 16.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. This may be another reaſon, why ſuch a Faith, as I have deſcribed, is made the condition of the Covenant of Salvation, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe it, beſt anſwers God's deſign in this Covenant, of renewing the Nature of Man in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, and by that means reſtoring it to Happineſs. For, by Faith Men are born of God, or made the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. <hi>Ye are all the Children of God by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Joh. 1.12, 13. <hi>As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the ſons of God, even to thoſe that believe on his Name. Which are born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi> Now, to be born of God, or, which is the ſame, to be made the Child of God, is to have ones Nature reſtored to the likeneſs of God, in which Man was firſt made, and is the ſame thing with that which is called <hi>Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and a being <hi>born again,</hi> and <hi>a new Creature.</hi> Which new Creature, or the Nature of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>n renewed by Faith, is alſo called the <hi>new Man, which after God, is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs,</hi> Epheſ. 4.24. To be born again, is to have the Faculties of Mans Nature reſtored to a rectitude in their motions and operations, in reference both to God and Man, to be reſtored to their proper moral uſe for which they were made. It is, in a word, that which is called a being <hi>made partakers of a Divine Nature.</hi> For thoſe which are begotten of God, are begotten in, or to his likeneſs. Men can adopt thoſe which are not their natural Children to inherit their Eſtates, but they cannot adopt them to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of their Moral Endowments. But God adopts his Children to a participation with him in the Inheritance, by adopting them to a participation of the Moral Perfections of his Nature; that is, to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilitude to him in them.</p>
                        <p>And this we ſay is done by Faith; that is, by Faith in God, and by Faith in his Word. For, in order of Nature, God is firſt believed to be a God of Truth, before his Word is believed to be the Word of Truth. And the creditableneſs of his Word depends upon the knowledge or belief or the fidelity of his Nature. And this Truth of God, and of his Word, is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:151517:16"/> the immediate Object of Faith. By Faith, a Man believes that to be true, which God reveals or declares as his Mind and Will, let the Import of it be what it will. But then, this Faith operates upon the Will and Affections, according to the Tenour and Import of that which is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. If it be matter of ſad import, it works a hatred to him that threatens it, and a fear of the thing threatned, if it be apprehended to proceed from an enemy. And this is the effect of the Faith of Devils, who believe, and hate God, who believe and tremble, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.19. But if that which is Revealed by God, and Believed by Man, betoken unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able love and good-will in God to Man, and matter of the greateſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to him, as a proof of ſuch love, then it worketh love to him that expreſſeth ſuch love, (<hi>for Faith worketh by Love,</hi> Gal. 5.6.) and a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſire after the promiſed benefit. And as the Soul grows more and more in love with God, becauſe of his love; in love with his Bleſſed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Divine Perfections; ſuch as are his Love and Goodneſs, Truth and Faithfulneſs, Purity and Patience, Mercifulneſs, and readineſs to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, which render him altogether lovely; ſo it contracts a likeneſs to God in theſe upon the Soul, and ſo changes and renews the Moral habit and conſtitution of the Soul, and conſequently the whole Life. There is an aptneſs and promptneſs in Men to imitate that in others (and ſo in God) for which they love them. And frequent imitating Acts, beget Habits, Cuſtom changing Nature. And hence it is, that through Faith we are made partakers of a Divine Nature. <hi>We all with open face, behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as in a Glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame Image, from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> 2. Cor. 3.18. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the glory of the Lord, is by Faith, (<hi>For we walk by Faith, and not by ſight,</hi> 2. Cor. 5.7. and by it <hi>Moſes ſaw him who is inviſible,</hi> Heb. 11.27.) And the <hi>medium</hi> by which this Proſpect is taken, is the Goſpel, by which the Lord in his lovely Perfections is now openly revealed: And Faith being from time to time buſied in beholding of, and converſing with theſe Perfections, it transforms the Soul into the ſame Image or likeneſs, <hi>from glory to glory,</hi> (that is gradually) <hi>as by the Spirit of the Lord;</hi> that is, through the co-operation of God's Spirit with Man's Faith. <hi>To compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the breadth, length, depth, and heighth, and to know the love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge,</hi> is the way to be <hi>filled with all the fullneſs of God,</hi> by tranſcribing all his imitable Perfections upon the Soul, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.18, 19.</p>
                        <p>And it is by virtue of their Relation to Chriſt, and being thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten and born of God, and made partakers of a new Nature conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God's, that Men can with confidence call God Father: This bleſſed effect of God's Spirit, is the Spirit of Adoption, by which they cry, <hi>Abba,</hi> Father. And it is this new Nature, that is the Spring and Fountain of a good Life, of all pious and virtuous Actions. As it is ſaid of God, <hi>Thou art good, and doſt good;</hi> ſo it is true of all thoſe that are born of him. <hi>A good Man, out of the good treaſure of his heart,</hi> (thus renewed) <hi>bringeth forth good fruit: The Tree being good, the Fruit will be good.</hi> And as this new Creature groweth up to ſtrength and maturity, ſo doing of good, and acting worthily, will become natural and pleaſant to him in whom it is. To ſuch an one <hi>the Commandments of God
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:151517:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> are not grievous,</hi> but he will be able in ſome good meaſure to ſay <hi>I delight to do thy will, O God, yea thy Law is in my heart.</hi> And for ſin, it being contrary to this New Nature, there is a kind of Moral Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency in him in whom it is, to commit ſin: <hi>He cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.9. Or if ſuch an one be overtaken in a fault, it will work a diſturbance in the Soul, juſt as that will in the Stomach, which a Man hath eaten, againſt which he hath an antipathy in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But as for ſuch as perform Religious Duties, and do things materially good, only by the ſtrength of extrinſecal Motives, and not from an inward Principle of this New Nature, or love to the things themſelves; to ſuch, thoſe Actions, being unnatural, become grievous and burdenſome, and will be continued in no longer, than thoſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives continue in their ſtrength.</p>

                        <p>The laſt thing I propoſed to conſider about God's Promiſe to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> is, <hi>What we are to underſtand by God's counting Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Faith to him for Righteouſneſs.</hi> And I take it to ſignifie thus much: That God in a way of ſpecial Grace, or by virtue of a New Law of Grace and Favour which was eſtabliſhed by God in Chriſt, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17.) that is, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to what Chriſt was to do and ſuffer in time then to come, did reckon his Practical Faith to him for Righteouſneſs; that is, that which in the eye of the New Law ſhould paſs in his eſtimation for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſubordinate to Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, which procured this Grant, or Law. For otherwiſe, Faith, neither as it is the Condition of the Promiſe of Remiſſion of Sin through Chriſt, nor as it works Repentance for ſins paſt, or ſincere Obedience for time to come, is Righteouſneſs in the Eye of the Original Law. For that accounts no Man that hath, though but once, tranſgreſſed it, to be Righteous, either upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of anothers ſuffering for his ſin, or his own Repentance or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere imperfect Obedience; but Curſeth every Man that from firſt to laſt continueth not in all things which are contained in that Law. But it is, as I ſaid, an Act of God's ſpecial Favour, and by virtue of his New Law of Grace, and as it is eſtabliſhed in Chriſt, that ſuch a Faith as I have deſcribed, comes to be reckoned, or imputed to a Man for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and through God's imputing it for Righteouſneſs to ſtand a Man in the ſame, if not in better ſtead, as to his Eternal Concerns, as a perfect fulfilling of the Original Law from firſt to laſt, would have done; Chriſt's Righteouſneſs being preſuppoſed the only Meritorious Cauſe of this Grant or Covenant.</p>
                        <p>And thus indeed the Faith which I have deſcribed, is a Man's Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs in the Eye of this New Law, becauſe it is ſummarily all that is required <hi>of him himſelf</hi> to make him capable of the Benefits promiſed by it; which, as it is now revealed, is the Goſpel. Juſtification is a Law-term: And no Man ſhall be Juſtified in Judgment, or upon Tryal, but he that is Juſt in the Eye of this New Law of Grace, as every one that rightly Believes, Repents and ſincerely Obeys, is; becauſe that is all that it requires of a Man himſelf to his Juſtification and Salvation.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:151517:17"/> And yet every Believer's Juſtification will be all of Grace, becauſe the Law by which they are Juſtified, is wholly of Grace, is wholly a Law of Grace, and was Enacted in meer Grace and Favour to undone Man, that was utterly undone by the Fall.</p>
                        <p>There are two things which I conceive do conſtitute and make up the Righteouſneſs of the Law of Grace; (preſuppoſing all to be procured by the Purchaſe which Chriſt hath made) firſt, The Righteouſneſs which conſiſteth in the <hi>forgiveneſs of ſins;</hi> and ſecondly, The Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of <hi>ſincere Obedience.</hi> And in reference to both theſe, Faith is imputed for Righteouſneſs, by virtue of the Law of Grace.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> Faith, as practical, is imputed to a Man for Righteouſneſs, as it is That, and all That which is required of him himſelf by the Law of Grace, to entitle him to the Righteouſneſs which conſiſteth in the Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins through Chriſt. Now, that remiſſion of Sins is part of the Righteouſneſs which is by Faith, is evident from <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5, 6, 7, 8. Where the Apoſtle, to prove that a Man's Faith in God who juſtifyeth the ungodly, is counted to him for Righteouſneſs, he citeth a paſſage out of <hi>Pſalm</hi> the 32d, <hi>Even as David alſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>deſcribeth the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs of the man to whom God imputeth Righteouſneſs without Works, ſaying, Bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe ſins are covered. Bleſſed is the man, to whom the Lord will not impute ſin.</hi> The Righteouſneſs imputed in this ſenſe, doth conſiſt in the non-imputation of ſin. Not to impute ſin, is not to reckon a Man not to have ſinned; but it is to deal with him, not according to the demerit of his ſin, it is to pardon him, for Chriſt's ſake, upon his penitential Faith, and not to puniſh him for his ſin; and this by vertue of a New Law or Act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity, or Covenant of Grace. For although pardon of ſin is obtained for Man by Chriſt's Sufferings for ſin, (<hi>In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveneſs of ſins,</hi> Epheſ. .1 7. and though God, <hi>for Chriſt's ſake doth forgive us,</hi> Epheſ. 4.32.) yet the actual collation of this great Benefit, is not promiſed, but upon condition of Man's Faith. <hi>Him hath God ſet forth to be a Propitiation;</hi> but it is <hi>through Faith in his blood,</hi> Rom. 3.25. <hi>By him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which ye could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes,</hi> Acts 13.39. and 10.43. Although Chriſt is the Propitiation for the ſins of the whole World, (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2.) yet that ſaying of Chriſt muſt and will take place; <hi>If ye believe not that I am he, ye ſhall dye in your ſins,</hi> Joh. 8.24. And that alſo, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth not, ſhall be damned.</hi> So that Faith is imputed for Righteouſneſs, partly as it is the Condition upon which Pardon of ſin is granted.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Faith is imputed for Righteouſneſs, which is practical, or productive of ſincere Obedience, without which property it is not a fulfilling of the Law of Grace as a Condition of the promiſed Benefits: and conſequently, cannot juſtifie a Man in the Eye of that Law. For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1ſt, Repentance, and likewiſe forgiving Men their Injuries (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) are ſuch Acts of Obedience, as without which a Man cannot be Pardoned; and if not Pardoned, then not Juſtified. And therefore, Faith is not imputed for Righteouſneſs, unleſs it be productive of Obedience.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="23" facs="tcp:151517:17"/>2dly, No <hi>Faith is available</hi> to Juſtification, but ſuch as <hi>worketh by Love,</hi> Gal. 5.6. Which to ſay, is all one as to ſay, no Faith is imputed for Righteouſneſs, but ſuch as worketh by <hi>keeping the Commandments of God, and fulfilling the Law;</hi> for that is the interpretation of Love, both to God and Men, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.10.</p>
                        <p n="3">3dly, <hi>Abraham</hi> who was ſet forth by God for a Pattern of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying Men by Faith, was Juſtified by ſuch Works as were the fruits of his Faith; and not only by his Faith, which was the Root of them: And therefore his Faith as practical, was imputed to him for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And ſuch muſt be the Faith of all others that ſhall obtain Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation upon their Believing as he did, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.21, 22, 23. <hi>Was not Abraham our Father juſtified by Works, when he had offered Iſaac his Son upon the Altar? Seeſt thou how Faith wrought with his Works; and by Works was Faith made perfect. And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith, Abraham Believed God, and it was imputed to him for Righteouſneſs.</hi> Where note theſe four things. 1. That <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith wrought with his Works about the ſame End, as a Condition of obtaining it; to wit, his Juſtification. 2. That by his Works his Faith was made perfect; to wit, in its aptitude by God's Inſtitution, to juſtifie him; without which, it would not have reached that End. 3. Note, further, That it was his Faith, as it wrought with his Works, and as it was compleated and made perfect by them, that was imputed to him for Righteouſneſs. 4. Note, That in the Imputation of his Faith for Righteouſneſs, as it was thus accompanied with, and perfected by Works, was the Scripture fulfilled, which ſaith, <hi>Abraham Believed God, and it was imputed to him for Righteouſneſs.</hi> And if ſo, then the Juſtification by Works, together with Faith, of which St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks here, is a Juſtification before God, and not before Men only, and to a Man's own Conſcience: For of ſuch a Juſtification doth the Scripture in <hi>Gen</hi> 15.6. ſpeak, which is here cited by St. <hi>James.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nor doth this, that Faith accompanied with Obedience is imputed for Righteouſneſs, at all derogate from the Obedience and Sufferings of Chriſt, in reference to the Ends for which they ſerve. Becauſe the whole Covenant, and all the parts and terms of it, both promiſes of Benefits, and the Condition on which they are promiſed, are all foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Chriſt his undertaking for us, and all the Benefits of it accrue to us, upon our Believing and Obeying, upon his account, and for his ſake. <hi>We are in him, who of God is made unto us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, and Redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. <hi>For which cauſe alſo he is called the Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi> Not as if his Perſonal Obedience to the Law, was ſo formally imputed to us, as that we ſhould be reckoned to have kept the Law in his keeping of it, (which hath been the Opinion of ſome) for if that had been ſo, there would have been no more need that Chriſt ſhould have Suffered for us, than there was that he ſhould have Suffered for himſelf, who had no ſin; for neither ſhould we, if we had perfectly kept the Law in him, or in his keeping of it.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> For what Ends the Law was added to the Promiſe.</head>
                     <p>I Now come to ſhew, in the next place, <hi>for what end the Law of Moſes was added to the Promiſe.</hi> And before I do this in particular, I ſhall note only in general, That it was not added to croſs or confront the Promiſe, or God's Deſign in it, but to be ſubſervient to it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Is the Law then againſt the Promiſes? God forbid.</hi> For it is not to be thought that God would prevaricate in his Deſign, ſo that when he had once made a New Law of Grace for the Saving of faln Man, he would yet afterwards give any Law, but what ſhould one way or other ſubſerve to the ſame End, if Men do not deprive themſelves of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Benefit, by perverting it. And therefore, to be ſure, God did not intend to revive the Old Covenant of Works made with <hi>Adam in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,</hi> in the after promulgation of the Law of Nature (which we call the Moral Law) already broken. He did not therein come to demand his full Debt of Innocency in Mans Broken and Bankrupt Condition, or to let him know, that he would, without any other Condition than perfect Innocency, <hi>caſt him into Priſon, until he had paid the utmoſt farthing.</hi> For if he had, then the Law indeed would have been againſt the Promiſe, which declares quite otherwiſe. It is true, the Law of Nature, as it is a perfect Rule of natural Righteouſneſs, founded in God's Nature and Man's Nature, doth of it ſelf require perfect Innocency, and can require no leſs, being ſuited to the Nature of Man in its perfect State: But when God brings this Law forth, and ſets it before Men that are now faln from that ſtate, as he doth in the promulgation of it, it is to let them know indeed what they once were, and from whence they are fallen, and how unhappy their Condition now is, according to the Tenour and Terms of that Law; and that it would have continued ſo for ever, if God had not made a New Law of Grace, to over-rule that Law; and to let all know that they ſhall ſtill remain in that Condition, that wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exclude themſelves from the benefit of the Law of Grace, by not performing the Condition of it: But not to let them know, they ſhould have no better terms from him than that Law affords them, nor to make their perfect keeping of it the condition of their Juſtification. But the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> entirely taken in all its parts, was rather given as an Appendix to the Promiſe, both as a Rule of the material part of that Obedience, which God would now require of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with their Faith in the Promiſe, and as a Motive to that Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: This in general.</p>
                     <p>The Queſtion is put, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Wherefore then ſerveth the Law?</hi> And the Anſwer there is, That <hi>it was added becauſe of tranſgreſſion, until the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:151517:18"/> Seed ſhould come.</hi> And it was added becauſe of tranſgreſſion in more reſpects than one.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It was added to diſcover Sin, to make that known to be Sin, which was ſo of it ſelf, and in its own nature, before the promulgation of the Law. For by reaſon of that grievous Wound which Man got in his Underſtanding by the Fall, and by reaſon alſo of a progreſſive De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation in Mankind, the natural Senſe of Moral Good and Evil, was to a great degree worn out of the minds of Men. For the repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of which decay, a promulgate Law (the Ten Commandments) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the Law of pure Nature in the Spirituality of it, was ſet on foot in the World. And by this Law came Sin and Duty to be more clearly known than they were before. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. <hi>By the Law is the knowledge of Sin.</hi> Rom. 7.7. <hi>I had not known Sin, but by the Law: For I had not known Luſt, except the Law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not Covet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Law was added, not only barely to make known that to be Sin, which was ſo of it ſelf before, but to ſet it out in its Colours, to make it known in the horrid nature and conſequence of it, that Men might be the more afraid to have to do with it, <hi>The Law entred, that the offence might abound:</hi> That is, that by that means it might be rendred the more Criminous and Demeritorious: That <hi>Sin by the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, might become exceeding ſinful,</hi> Rom. 5.20. and 7.13.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Law as it diſcovered Sin, and made it more criminous, and the People the more ſenſible of guilt, and more apprehenſive of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxiouſneſs to puniſhment, was given to ſet off ſo much the more, the Glory, Beauty, and Deſirableneſs of God's Grace in the Promiſe of Pardon and Salvation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. <hi>The Law entered that the offence might abound: But where Sin abounded, Grace did much more abound.</hi> By how much the more Sin appeared Sin, and was enhanced, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated, and rendred manifeſtly miſchievous by a Promulgate Law; by ſo much the more Grace appear'd to be Grace, in all its Glory, that brought Deliverance from it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.21. <hi>That like as Sin hath reigned unto death,</hi> (viz. <hi>by the Law,</hi> that being the ſtrength of Sin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56.) <hi>Even ſo Grace might reign through Righteouſneſs unto eternal life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> After Chriſt came, the Reſt which he gave, was ſo much the more ſweet to thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> who received him, by how much they had been weary and heavy-laden under a Spirit of Bondage before.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>The Law</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul) was our Schoolmaſter, to bring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s unto Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by Faith,</hi> Gal. 3.24. That is, It was a lower ſort of Inſtitution, accommodated to the weak and more imperfect ſtate of the Church, until afterward it ſhould deliver them over to a more perfect Inſtitution under Chriſt. Parents firſt teach their Children to Speak, and after put them to School to learn Letters, Syllables, Words, and Sentences; the uſe and deſign of all which they do not underſtand while they are Children, as they do when they come to be Men. In proportion to this hath God dealt with his Church in the World, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with a lower and more imperfect ſort of Inſtruction, Precepts, and Promiſes, and ſo proceeding to thoſe that are higher and more perfect, and ſo by certain gradations, to lead on, and build up his
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:151517:19"/> Church to a more perfect Spiritual and compleat ſtate of Faith and Holineſs; <hi>To all the riches of fulneſs of underſtanding of the Myſtery of God, of the Father, and of Chriſt,</hi> Col. 2.2. And thus the Law, as Schoolmaſter, had a double end and uſe: The one reſpecting the time then preſent: The other that which was then future and to come.</p>
                     <p>The then preſent uſe of it was twofold alſo.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To reclaim and reſtrain them from the Superſtitious Cuſtoms of the Heathen, to which they were addicted; in which reſpect alſo it <hi>was added becauſe of tranſgreſſion.</hi> The Heathen-Worſhip, ſtood in divers Superſtitious Rites or Ceremonies: And becauſe the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were addicted to a bodily Worſhip like theirs, (for they ſaid, <hi>Let us make us Gods to go before us,</hi> Exod. 32.1.) and were in danger thereby of being drawn to Worſhip their Gods, therefore to prevent this (as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents put their Children to School, partly to keep them out of harms way) the Lord by way of condeſcention to their childiſh humour, did ordain a Worſhip conſiſting much in bodily Exerciſe, and Inſtituted divers Laws, <hi>which ſtood in Meats and Drinks, and divers Waſhings, and carnal Ordinances, until the time of Reformation;</hi> till he ſhould, by ſending his Son, appoint more excellent Laws for Reforming both them and the reſt of the World. <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.3, 4, 5. <hi>After the doings of the Land of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt wherein ye dwelt ſhall ye not do; and after the doings of the Land of Canaan whither I bring you ſhall ye not do; neither ſhall ye walk in their Ordinances. Ye ſhall therefore keep my Statutes and my Judgments: Which if a Man do, he ſhall live in them,</hi> Ezek. 20.6, 11.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Lord did Inſtitute divers Temporary Laws for tryal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their Obedience in thoſe leſſer things for a time, as being ſuch as they were as yet beſt capable to receive, thereby to lead them on to higher inſtances of Obedience afterward. Thoſe many Ceremonies which they were obliged to obſerve, were not things of any natural or intrinſick Goodneſs, but only made uſe of by God for a preſent turn, which when that was ſerved, they (as to practiſe) were of no value, but became <hi>beggerly Elements.</hi> But yet while they continued commanded of God, their Obedience in the uſe of them, was Rewardable, as well as their Obedience to any other Laws.</p>
                     <p>The other end and uſe of the Law, as it was a Schoolmaſter, reſpected the time then to come. For the High Prieſthood, and Sacrifices of the Law, as they were Types of what Chriſt ſhould be, do, and ſuffer, as Mediator, were of great uſe to the <hi>Jews</hi> after Chriſt had Suffered, and was Riſen again, and Aſcended into Heaven, to facilitate both the knowledge and belief of the Myſtery of Redemption by Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To facilitate the knowledge thereof, and to beget in them a right <hi>Notion</hi> of thoſe things in Chriſt, by which forgiveneſs of ſins, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God, is obtained on our behalf. For thoſe who had long ſeen and known the effect of Legal Sacrifices, as how they did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Legal Impunity for Offences commited, God accepting the Life of a Beaſt that had not ſinned, inſtead of the life of a Man that had, might ſoon come to underſtand, by parity of reaſon, that God would much more accept of his own Sons offering himſelf in Sacrifice for us, ſo as to excuſe us from ſuffering Eternal Puniſhment for our ſin. <hi>For if the blood
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:151517:19"/> of Bulls, and of Goats, and the aſhes of an Heifer ſprinkling the unclean, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth to the purifying of the fleſh; how much more ſhall the Blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal Spirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God, purge your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience from dead works, to ſerve the living God?</hi> Heb. 9.13, 14. And ſo the High Prieſt's entering into the Holy of Holies in the behalf of the People with the Blood of the Sacrifice, and burning Incenſe there, doth greatly aſſiſt the mind in underſtanding the nature of Chriſt's Interceſſion for us in Heaven, in virtue of his Bloodſhed for us on Earth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Law, in the Typical nature of it, was of great uſe to the <hi>Jews,</hi> to facilitate and ſtrengthen their Belief in Chriſt; and ſo were the Predictions of the Prophets in conjunction with it: For theſe and the accompliſhment of them in Chriſt, did ſo anſwer each other, as in Water, Face anſwereth to Face, that thoſe who believed the Law and the Prophets, had a great advantage by means thereof, to believe in Chriſt. And therefore our bleſſed Saviour, when he would ſatisfie his Diſciples touching himſelf, that he was indeed the Chriſt, and of the neceſſity of his Death, (which Death occaſioned at firſt a ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering in their Faith) <hi>beginning at Moſes, and all the Prophets, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to them in all the Scriptures, the things concerning himſelf,</hi> Luke 24.27. And St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he laboured the Converſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> to Chriſtianity, as the chiefeſt way to effect it; <hi>he expounded to them, and teſtified the Kingdom of God, perſwading them concerning Jeſus, both out of the Law of Moſes, and of the Prophets, from morning to evening,</hi> Acts 28.23. <hi>Had ye believed Moſes</hi> (Saith our Saviour to them) <hi>ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me: But if ye believe not his Writings, how ſhall ye believe my Words?</hi> Joh. 5.46, 47. And thus in both the forementioned reſpects, the Law was a Schoolmaſter indeed, to bring them to Chriſt, that they might be Juſtified by Faith.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Law was given to the Jewiſh Nation, not only for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoof and benefit, but alſo for a general Good to the World: That the Nations round about, hearing of ſuch excellent Laws, and percieving how happy and proſperous thoſe People were, ſo long as they obſerved them; might thereby be invited to quit their Idol Gods, and to <hi>take hold of the Covenant, and to join themſelves to the people of the God of Abraham,</hi> even as it came to paſs in ſuch as were Proſelited. And upon this account it ſeems to be, that the Pſalmiſt prayed thus: <hi>God be merciful unto us, and bleſs us, and cauſe thy Face to ſhine upon us: That thy way may be known on Earth, thy ſaving health unto all Nations,</hi> Pſal. 67.1, 2. and concludes <hi>ver.</hi> 7. That if God ſhould ſo do, his fear would be propagated through the World: <hi>God ſhall bleſs us, and all the ends of the Earth ſhall fear him,</hi> Deut. 4.6, 7, 8. <hi>Keep therefore and do them, for this is your Wiſdom, and your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding in the ſight of the Nations, who ſhall hear all theſe Statutes, and ſay, ſurely this great Nation is a Wiſe and an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding People. For what Nation is there ſo great, that hath God ſo nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for? And what Nation is there ſo great, that hath Statutes and Judgments ſo Righteous, as all this Law which I ſet before you this day?</hi> To them were <hi>committed the Oracles of God,</hi> Rom. 3.2. They were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in truſt to them as Feoffees for the World, to communicate the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:151517:20"/> knowledge of God and of his Laws to the Nations; to carry on further the Reformation of the World, begun in their Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> and which was promiſed to be more compleatly effected by the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> in that all Nations of the Earth ſhould be Bleſſed in him. And as God's Judgments on the <hi>Jews</hi> for breaking his Laws, was Admonitory to the Nations about them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.24,—28. ſo his famous Deliverances wrought for them upon their Repentance for breaking his Laws, made God known abroad to be a great favourer of ſuch as repent of their worſhipping and ſerving other Gods, and ſuch a one as could and would Save, Deliver and Bleſs them, that turned to him, to ſerve him only. Which ſeems to be his meaning, when he ſaith, he <hi>will be ſanctified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Heathen, when he ſhould gather them from among the people where they were Captives,</hi> and that <hi>the Heathen ſhould know that he was the the Lord,</hi> Ezek. 20.41. and 36, 23. And by this means he brought them to fear and worſhip the God of <hi>Iſrael. </hi> Pſal. 102.13, 15. <hi>Thou ſhalt ariſe and have mercy upon Zion; So the Heathen ſhall fear the Name of the Lord; and all the Kings of the Earth thy glory. When the Lord turned again the Captivity of Sion, they ſaid among the Heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them,</hi> Pſal. 126.1, 2.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The whole Law was given to be a Political Inſtrument of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> (according to that ſtate of their minority) as a peculiar Republick, of which God himſelf was the Soveraign Legiſlator. But of this more afterward.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Shewing by what Faith and Practice the Jews under the Law were Saved.</head>
                     <p>I Come now to ſhew <hi>by what Faith and Practice the Jews under the Law were Saved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And doubtleſs whatever it was, it became available to that end, upon the account of what Chriſt was to ſuffer, when he ſhould come. For, as I ſhewed before, that God's Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, (by virtue of which the Faithful then were ſaved) was <hi>confirmed in Chriſt;</hi> was eſtabliſhed with them in reference to what he was to do, and ſuffer, as Mediator afterwards, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. And <hi>by means of his Death, there was Redemption for the tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt Teſtament,</hi> Heb. 9.15. And the Sacrifices and Prieſthood, were <hi>a Figure for the time then preſent,</hi> of what Chriſt ſhould afterwards do, and ſuffer, and for what end.</p>
                     <p>But when I ſay ſo, I do not ſay that all that were Saved, did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſo much. For we ſee the Apoſtles of Chriſt, though they did believe him to be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> expected, yet they did not underſtand or expect that he ſhould ſuffer Death as a Sacrifice, till
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:151517:20"/> he told them ſo: Nay, the thing was ſo far from their thoughts, as that they did not underſtand him, when he plainly foretold them of his Death, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.32. And if the Doctrine touching the reſemblance that is between the Prieſthood of <hi>Melchizedech,</hi> and the Prieſthood of Chriſt, was not in the Apoſtles ſenſe, <hi>Meat</hi> which <hi>Babes</hi> in Chriſtianity could well digeſt in their Underſtandings, but was <hi>Meat for ſtrong Men,</hi> Heb. 5.10.—14. we may well gueſs by that, how little the <hi>Jews</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Typical and Spiritual ſenſe of thoſe Types about which they were frequently converſant; and therefore it's ſaid, that the leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven, is greater than <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> though he was ſo great, that there was none greater before him. Hence we may ſee, that one reaſon why thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> were all their life-time under a Spirit of Bondage to fear, was the great Obſcurity of the Declaration of God's purpoſe of Grace to the World through Chriſt, and the Way and Method of Salvation by him. <hi>Moſes was but a ſervant for a Teſtimony of thoſe things, which were [after] to be ſpoken,</hi> and ſo declared afterwards, as that the Typical meaning of them might be underſtood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.5. In the mean while, as touching thoſe things, <hi>they were ſhut up unto the Faith which ſhould [afterwards] be revealed,</hi> Gal. 3.23. It is ſaid of the Prophets, whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> was one, <hi>that not unto themſelves, but unto us they did miniſter the things which are now reported unto us, by them that have preached the Goſpel to us,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.12. Add we to all this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.8. where having ſpoken in <hi>ver.</hi> 7. of the High Prieſts entering alone into the Holy of Holies with the Blood of the Sacrifice in behalf of the People once every Year, he ſaith, <hi>The Holy Ghoſt this ſignifying, that the way into the Holieſt of all, was not yet made manifeſt, while as the firſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle was yet ſtanding.</hi> By the Holieſt of all, here, is meant Heaven, ſignified of old by the Holy of Holies, as appears, <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 24. And the plain meaning ſeems to be this, That the peoples entring into Heaven by the Sacrifice, and Blood, and Interceſſion of Chriſt, was not made manifeſt, while the Tabernacle-worſhip continued. For Chriſt is our Way into Heaven, (to the place <hi>within the Veil</hi>) by his Blood ſhed as a Sacrifice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20. <hi>Having therefore, Brethren, boldneſs to enter into the Holieſt by the Blood of Jeſus, by a new and living way, which he hath conſecrated for us through the Veil, that is to ſay, his Fleſh.</hi> But this Way, he tells us, was not made manifeſt, while the firſt Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle was ſtanding.</p>
                     <p>But as obſcure as this way was, as to what was to be done and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in particular by the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> yet they had ſome general grounds of Faith and Hope; That upon their Faith, Repentance, and ſedulous Endeavours to walk in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord, they ſhould obtain remiſſion of their ſins, and a future Happineſs in another World. Among which gounds theſe were not the leaſt:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They had the knowledge of the Promiſe of Bleſſedneſs to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, and of the Promiſe of thoſe other Benefits which were promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They had an addition of ſeveral other Predictions concerning the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> both by <hi>Moſes</hi> and other Prophets, that perhaps were
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:151517:21"/> ſomewhat more expreſs, ſuch as in <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.16. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. and others. Theſe Promiſes and Predictions, put them in great expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Special Benefits by the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and wrought in them a longing after his Day. Upon which account, our Saviour ſaid to his Diſciples: <hi>Bleſſed are your Eyes, for they ſee; and your Ears, for they hear. For I ſay unto you, that many Prophets and Kings, and Righteous Men, have deſired to ſee thoſe things which ye ſee, and have not ſeen them; and to hear thoſe things which ye hear, and have not heard them,</hi> Mat. 13.16, 17. Luke 10.23, 24.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They had large ſignifications from God of his ſpecial Favour to them above all people, as in chuſing them to be his peculiar People, and in declaring himſelf to be their God; in giving viſible ſigns of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence among them, and excellent Laws and Promiſes to them, and ſending his Prophets amongſt them, and working many Wonders for them, and caſting out the Nations before them, to make room for them, and the like, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6, 7, 8. and 26.18, 19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4, 5.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. They had expreſs Declaration from God of the Goodneſs of his Nature, and of his Compaſſion towards Sinners, and of his readineſs to Pardon ſuch as ſhould Repent and return to their Duty, in loving him, and keeping his Commandments. As for inſtance, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7. <hi>The Lord paſſed before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſs and truth, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy for thouſands, forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin.</hi> And when he delivered them his Law, with the greateſt terrour and aſtoniſhment to them; yet even then he aſſured them, That he would ſhew Mercy to Thouſands <hi>of them that love him, and keep his Commandments;</hi> as in the Second Commandment. And in eaſe of their miſcarriage to the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of God's Judgments upon them, he beſpeaks them thus: <hi>When thou art in tribulation, and all theſe things are come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the Lord thy God, and ſhalt be obedient to his Voice, (for the Lord thy God is a merciful God) he will not forſake thee, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the Covenant of thy Fathers,</hi> Deut. 4.31. and 30.1, 2, 3. Levit. 26.39, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>From all which grounds, the Faithful among them, had ſuch a hope and confidence of pardon of Sin, and of a future Happineſs in another Life, upon their Repentance and ſincere Obedience, as did effectually induce them to have good thoughts of God, to love him, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to pleaſe him, by having reſpect unto all his Commandments. This made him ſay, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.4. <hi>There is forgiveneſs with thee, that thou mayeſt be feared.</hi> And under <hi>this hope</hi> and confidence, <hi>the twelve Tribes did inſtantly ſerve God day and night,</hi> and grounded this Hope of theirs upon <hi>the Promiſe made of God unto their Fathers,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.6, 7.</p>
                     <p>And indeed, it was the unanimous Faith of the moſt eminent among them from Age to Age, that God had both made, and would keep a Covenant to ſhew Mercy to thoſe that love him, and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, or that walk before him with all their Heart: For that they looked upon as the Condition of God's Promiſe of ſhewing Mercy. This we may ſee in <hi>Moſes, David, Solomon,</hi> and in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:151517:21"/> 
                        <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> Deut. 7.9. <hi>Know therefore that the Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth Covenant and Mercy with them that love him, and keep his Commandments.</hi> So <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm 103.17, 18. <hi>The mercy of the Lord is from everlaſting to everlaſting to ſuch as keep his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and to thoſe that remember his Commandments to do them.</hi> And thus <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 Kings 8.23. <hi>And he ſaid, Lord God of Iſrael, there is no God like thee, who keepeſt Covenant and Mercy with thy ſervants, that walk before thee with all their heart.</hi> So <hi>Daniel,</hi> in his 9th Chap. 4th ver. <hi>O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the Covenant and Mercy, to them that love him, and to them that keep his Commandments.</hi> And <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> likewiſe, Chap. 1.5. <hi>I beſeech thee, O Lord God of Heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth Covenant and Mercy for them that love him, and obſerve his Commandments.</hi> This we ſee was the ſerious and conſtant Profeſſion of the Faith of the Servants of God in thoſe Times. And in this Faith and Practice doubtleſs it was, that they lived, and died, and were ſaved.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> That the Law contained a Covenant different from that with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IN the next place, I am to ſhew, <hi>That the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>did contain a Covenant diſtinct, and of a different nature from the Covenant which God made with</hi> Abraham <hi>and his Spiritual Seed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides the general Promiſe which God made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> reſpecting the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as well as the <hi>Jews, (In thee all Nations of the Earth ſhall be bleſſed)</hi> he made a Special Covenant with him, as a Reward of his ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Faithfulneſs, to give unto his Natural Seed the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> Nehem. 9.8. <hi>Thou foundeſt his heart faithful before thee, and madeſt a Covenant with him, to give the Land of the Canaanites — to his Seed.</hi> In order to the fulfilling of which Promiſe, after he had brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he united them under himſelf, as Head, in one Political Body, by a Political Covenant, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is the Covenant I am now to diſcourſe of. In which diſcourſe I would, 1. Shew in what reſpect the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to contain a Covenant of a different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham.</hi> 2. Prove that it did contain ſuch a different Covenant. 3. For farther illuſtration, conſider it in its parts, and their relation one to another. 4. And in what reſpect this Covenant is called the firſt Covenant, when as the Covenant of Grace was made before it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In what reſpect the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to contain a Covenant of a different nature from the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham.</hi> The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> comes under a twofold conſideration. 1. As in conjunction with the Promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to which it was annexed,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:151517:22"/> it made up one entire Law, by which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were to be governed and directed in the way to Eternal Life: And in this conjunction, the Promiſe was the Life and Soul as it were of the Body of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Law, properly taken. And in this ſenſe, as the word Law ſignifies the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> or five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> (which contain the Promiſe, as well as the Law) it is ſometimes uſed in the New Teſtament, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.21, 22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.34. <hi>Luke</hi> 16. And in this ſenſe doubtleſs we are to underſtand the Law upon which <hi>David</hi> beſtowed ſo many glorious <hi>Encomiums</hi> as he did, ſaying, <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 19.2. We are to conſider the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as given at <hi>Sinai,</hi> in a ſtricter ſenſe, as it was an <hi>Inſtrument</hi> or <hi>Rule</hi> of Government in the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The Law, in the former ſenſe of it, promiſed Eternal Life (though but obſcurely) to thoſe that did believe its Promiſes, and ſincerely obey its Precepts. In the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſenſe, it promiſed only temporal Bleſſings to thoſe that ſtrictly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it in all the parts of it; and threatned thoſe with temporal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities that did not. The ſame Laws materially of this Political Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, related to both the Covenants. As Eternal Life was promiſed in the Covenant of Grace, upon condition of ſincere Obedience to thoſe Laws, as an effect of Faith in the Promiſe; ſo thoſe Laws, in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with the Promiſe, were, as I may ſo ſay, Evangelical. But as temporal Benefits only were promiſed in that Covenant upon condition of ſtrict Obedience to thoſe Laws; and as thoſe Laws were enjoyned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der temporal Penalties, as they were Commonwealth-Laws; ſo that Covenant, containing thoſe Laws, was Political, and in this Political reſpect, it was another Covenant. If the Law of God, and the Law of Man command or forbid things materially the ſame; yet if the one command or forbid them under pain of Damnation, and the other only under temporal Penalties; theſe Laws are not formally the ſame. The Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had no Commonwealth-Laws, but what God himſelf gave them, the which Laws they alſo Covenanted with him to obſerve; by which Covenant they were united under him as Head of that Political Body. And therefore, when they would needs chooſe them a King like other Nations, God told <hi>Samuel,</hi> ſaying, <hi>They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I ſhould not Reign over them,</hi> 1 Sam. 8.7. <hi>Ye ſaid unto me</hi> (ſaid <hi>Samuel) nay, but a King ſhall Reign over us, when the Lord your God was your King,</hi> 1 Sam. 12.12. I conclude then, that as the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> did ſerve to this Political end; ſo it was a diſtinct Covenant, and different from the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let us ſee how this may be proved to be a Covenant ſo diſtinct and different, as I have ſaid, from the Covenant of Grace declared to <hi>Abraham.</hi> And to this purpoſe, theſe things are conſiderable.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, They are called the <hi>two Covenants,</hi> by St. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 4.24. And if they are Two, then there is a real difference between them, elſe they would be but one and the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, They bear diſtinct denominations; the one is called the <hi>firſt</hi> and the <hi>Old Covenant;</hi> and the other, the <hi>ſecond</hi> and the <hi>New,</hi> Heb. Chap. 8. and 9.</p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:151517:22"/>
                     <p>Thirdly, There were ſome ſins pardonable by one of thoſe Covenants, which were not ſo by the other; and that ſhews that they were quite of a different nature. The Murder and Adultery which <hi>David</hi> was guilty of, was not pardonable, according to the terms of the Political Covenant, if there had been any Superiour Power on Earth to have executed that Commonwealth-Law; and yet, according to the terms of the Covenant of Grace, they were pardonable upon Repentance, and upon thoſe terms were pardoned unto him. The like might be ſaid perhaps of <hi>Manaſſeh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The unbelief of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> in not <hi>Sanctifying God in the eyes of the Children of Iſrael,</hi> was, according to the terms of the Covenant of Grace, pardoned as to the Eternal Penalty, but yet was not wholly pardoned, according to the terms of the Political Covenant, as to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Puniſhment. For the Lord told them, that for that cauſe <hi>they ſhould not bring the Children of Iſrael into the Land of Canaan,</hi> Numb. 20.12. And in reference to this caſe, the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Thou waſt a God that forgaveſt them, though thou tookeſt vengeance of their inventions,</hi> Pſal. 99.8.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The Covenant of Grace never ceaſeth, but it is of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual duration throughout all Generations; and therefore is called the <hi>Everlaſting Covenant,</hi> Heb. 13.20. But this <hi>Moſaical</hi> Political Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is <hi>vaniſhed</hi> long ſince, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.13. by which alſo it appears to be a Covenant eſſentially different from the other.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For a farther illuſtration of the nature of this Covenant, we will conſider it in its parts, and in the relation which thoſe parts bear one towards another. And in general, it did conſiſt of two parts. 1. Of Laws; and, 2. Of the Sanction of thoſe Laws. The Laws likewiſe were of two ſorts: 1. Laws of Duty. 2. Laws of Indemnity.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Laws of Duty. And in them we may conſider, 1. What thoſe Laws were. 2. What manner of Obedience to thoſe Laws it was, which would free Men from the Penalties of them, and entitle them to the promiſes of Reward annexed to them.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The Laws of Duty, of which this Covenant did in great part conſiſt, were thoſe which paſs under the various denomination of Moral, Ritual, or Ceremonial, and Judicial. Some of which Laws, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Decalogue eſpecially and almoſt wholly) for the matter of them, were natural; that is, ſuch as were founded in the Nature of Man, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding things which of themſelves were Evil, and commanding things which in their own nature were Good, and might be diſcerned to be ſo, by Man in his pure Naturals, and in great part ſince the Degeneration of his nature, whether they had been expreſly forbidden, or comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or no. But theſe Laws became part of the Political Covenant, only as they were expreſly and externally declared to the <hi>Jews</hi> by a Promulgate Law. For if this had not been ſo, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> could not have been ſaid to be <hi>without the Law,</hi> as they were, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.21. For they had the force and <hi>effect of the Law in their hearts,</hi> and were in that reſpect <hi>a Law unto themſelves,</hi> Rom. 2.14, 15. But becauſe the Decalogue, as well as the other Laws, was delivered to the <hi>Jews</hi> only, and to none elſe, from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> therefore they only (and Proſelytes that joyned with them) were ſaid to be under the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:151517:23"/> Law, and all the reſt <hi>without Law.</hi> And therefore is the giving of the Law reckoned to the <hi>Jews</hi> among their peculiar Privileges, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. And in this ſenſe only, as the Decalogue was a part of the Political Law, can the <hi>Miniſtration ingraven in Stones</hi> be ſaid to be <hi>done away,</hi> as it is, 2 Cor. 3.7, to <hi>ver.</hi> 11. For ſo much of it as was a Copy of the Law of Nature, or is by Chriſt incorporated into his Laws, remains in force to all Men.</p>
                     <p>The other Laws of which this Covenant did conſiſt, were Arbitrary; the force of which did wholly depend upon Divine Inſtitution: And ſuch were the Laws Ceremonial; and a great part of thoſe we call Judicial.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That Obedience which would be ſufficient to ſecure a Man from the penalty of the Political Law, and to entitle him to the promiſed Reward annexed thereto, was no leſs than a ſtrict Obedience to it in all the parts of it. For it is written, <hi>Curſed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this Law to do them:</hi> And <hi>all the people ſhall ſay, Amen,</hi> Deut. 27.26. And this extended to Heart-obedience, and Heart-ſinning, as well as to the outward Act, commanding <hi>Love</hi> to God, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding to <hi>Covet,</hi> as under the Heart-ſearching Political Soveraign, who reſerved to himſelf the final Judgment and Execution, even in temporal reſpects, in many caſes.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Laws of Indemnity (of which alſo this Covenant did conſiſt) were partly thoſe which ordained Sacrifice and Offerings for the Expiation of many Sins made pardonable by thoſe Laws, ſo far as to exempt the delinquent Perſon from the temporal Penalty threatned for breach of thoſe other Laws, which for diſtinction ſake, I call Laws of Duty; for otherwiſe, theſe alſo were Laws of Duty, as well as of Privilege. There were other Laws of Indemnity likewiſe for the purification of Perſons legally unclean; which being obſerved, the Perſons unclean became delivered from the penalties they ſuffered while their unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was upon them; ſuch as was their Separation from the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
                     <p>Conſider we next the Sanction of theſe Laws; and that did conſiſt in Promiſes annexed to the obſerving of them, and in a Curſe denounced againſt the tranſgreſſors of them. And for our better underſtanding the nature of the Promiſes of this Covenant, we will conſider them Negatively, and Affirmatively.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Negatively; The Promiſes of this Political-Covenant, as ſuch, were not Promiſes of Eternal Life; And when I ſay ſo, I do not deny but that, firſt, the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, and before, had Promiſes of Eternal Life implyed in the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed. And accordingly, the faithful ones among them, ſought after the <hi>Heavenly Country,</hi> and <hi>looked for a City which hath foundations, whoſe builder and maker is God,</hi> Heb. 11.10, 14, 16. Nor ſecondly, will I deny but that there are ſome paſſages in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> if you take the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> in a large ſenſe, which look ſomewhat like a renewal of the antient Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> to his Seed. As when, for inſtance, God made a conditional Promiſe to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, to <hi>be their God, and that they ſhould be his People,</hi> as in <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.12. <hi>Deut.</hi>
                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:151517:23"/> 29.13. Which form of words is interpreted ſometimes to imply a future Happineſs in another World, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.31, 32. And I do not deny, but the <hi>Jews</hi> had by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as expreſs a Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> had, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.15. — 19. But St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſpeak of the Law in this large ſenſe, when he oppoſeth the Law and the Promiſe, the Law and Faith, one to another. But if we underſtand by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Law as Political, the Law of the Commonwealth; ſo the Promiſes of it were not Promiſes of Eternal Life; For Promiſes of this nature did pertain to another Covenant, to wit, that made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Spiritual Seed as ſuch.</p>
                     <p>Firſt; Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth downrightly deny that the Promiſe of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Inheritance, (which in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. is called <hi>the Eternal Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>) was by the Law, which yet it would have been, if by Law he had meant the Law in that large ſenſe, in which the Law and Promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> are conjoyned; and not in that ſtrict ſenſe, by which he means the Political Law diſtinctly. And if the Inheritance had been promiſed upon the ſame terms as temporal Bleſſings were in the temporal Covenant, the Inheritance might have been obtained by the Law, as well as temporal Bleſſings were. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13. <hi>For the Promiſe that he ſhould be Heir of the World, was not through the Law, but through the Righteouſneſs of Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, St. <hi>Paul</hi> evinceth the badneſs of that Opinion, to think that Eternal Life was promiſed upon the Law-terms, from the abſurd conſequence of it; ſhewing that if it were, that then it would make void the Promiſe of God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the way of ſaving Men by Faith in that Promiſe, of none effect: <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.18. <hi>For if the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance be of the Law, it is no more of Promiſe: But God gave it to Abraham by Promiſe.</hi> Rom. 4.14. <hi>For if they which are of the Law be Heirs, Faith is made void, and the Promiſe made of none effect.</hi> It was altogether unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to think that the Inheritance ſhould be promiſed upon ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and inconſiſtent terms, as are Faith in the Promiſe, and by Works of the Law.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Law,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is not of Faith, but the man that doth them, ſhall live in them,</hi> Gal. 3.12. meaning, that what the Law promiſed, it did not promiſe it upon condition of Believing, but upon condition of Doing. And Eternal Life is not ſince the Fall promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon condition of Doing, without Faith, but upon condition of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; <hi>For the Juſt ſhall live by Faith,</hi> Verſ. 11. And therefore Eternal Life is promiſed by the Law.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Wherefore elſe are the Promiſes of that <hi>better Covenant,</hi> Heb. 8.6. ſaid to <hi>be better Promiſes?</hi> But becauſe they are Promiſes of better things than were promiſed in the firſt Covenant; which yet they could not be, if Eternal Life had been promiſed in that Covenant, becauſe that is the beſt of all Promiſes.</p>
                     <p>To ſay they are better only in reſpect of Adminiſtration, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Revelation, will not ſatisfie ſuch as ſhall well conſider, That if the betterneſs of the Covenant and Promiſes lay only in that, the difference would not be ſo great as to denominate them two Covenants, and two ſo vaſtly diſtant as the Scripture repreſents them to be. The
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:151517:24" rendition="simple:additions"/> difference then would be but only gradual, as that is, which is found in the ſame Covenant of Grace, in the ſeveral Editions of it, to <hi>Adam,</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> and now to all Nations ſince Chriſt's coming; and not Eſſential, as that between the two Covenants ſeems to be, as it is repreſented in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24. Beſides, St. <hi>Paul</hi> repreſents the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the two Covenants, to differ as much, as Righteouſneſs and Condemnation, Life and Death differ, which ſure is more than a gradual difference. The one is <hi>the Miniſtration of Death and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;</hi> the other, <hi>the Miniſtration of Righteouſneſs and Life,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>The Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did,</hi> Heb. 7.19. By which it appears again, that the hope of the Goſpel in which the things hoped for upon the Promiſes of the Goſpel (are not the leaſt) is better than what the Law promiſed the obſervers of it. <hi>This is the Promiſe which he hath promiſed us, even Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life,</hi> John. 2.25.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And Affirmatively; It was then a long and proſperous Life in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that was promiſed in the firſt Covenant. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.11. <hi>The Lord ſhall make thee plenteous in Goods, in the fruit of thy Body. and in the fruit of thy Cattel, and in the fruit of thy Ground, in the Land which the Lord ſware unto thy Fathers to give thee.</hi> Deut. 11.21. <hi>That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your Children, as the days of Heaven upon Earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A great variety of outward Bleſſings is promiſed, as the Reward of keeping that Covenant. And therefore Wiſdom under that Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is deſcribed, as having <hi>length of days in her right hand, and in her left hand Riches and Honour; whoſe ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths peace,</hi> Prov. 3.17. And as this Covenant was National, ſo there were Promiſes of National Bleſſings; ſuch as was the <hi>ſetting them on high, above all the Nations of the Earth;</hi> making them <hi>the Head and not the Tail:</hi> The giving them <hi>victory over enemies; multiplying the Nation,</hi> and beſtowing on it, Health, Peace, and Plenty, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.</p>
                     <p>When it's ſaid once by <hi>Moſes,</hi> thrice by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and twice by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>the Man that doth them, ſhall live in them,</hi> (Lev. 18.5. Ezek. 20.11, 13, 21. Rom. 10.5. Gal. 3.12.) thereby Epitomizing the firſt Covenant; I conceive that by <hi>Living,</hi> is meant a long and proſperous Life in this World. As on the contrary, the condition of one greatly afflicted, is in Scripture-Dialect, a kind of Death, and ſuch an one ſaid to <hi>be free among the Dead,</hi> Pſal. 88.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. And that which inclines me ſo to think, is not only the reaſons already given to prove that no other Life was promiſed in the firſt Covenant, but alſo the congruity of this ſenſe with other paſſages in the Writings of <hi>Moſes.</hi> As <hi>Deut.</hi> 30 15. <hi>See, I have ſet before you this day, Life and Good, Death and Evil.</hi> If you would know what is meant by Life here, the next Verſe will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you: <hi>That thou mayeſt live and multiply, and the Lord thy God ſhall bleſs thee in the Land whither thou goeſt to poſſeſs it.</hi> The contrary where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is the Death he had ſet before them, ſaying, <hi>I denounce unto you this day, that ye ſhall ſurely periſh, and that ye ſhall not prolong your days upon the Land,</hi> &amp;c. Deut. 32.46, 47. <hi>Set your hearts unto all the words which I teſtifie among you this day, for it is not a vain thing for you, becauſe it is your life; and through this thing ye ſhall prolong your days in the Land
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:151517:24"/> wherein ye go.</hi> The latter words are exegetical of the former: Through this thing ye ſhall prolong your days, is the interpretation of thoſe; <hi>it is your Life.</hi> And it may be conſidered alſo, whether this Particle <hi>[in]</hi> (which if a Man do, he ſhall even live <hi>[in]</hi> them) may not determine the nature and kind of that Reward which was promiſed in the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as it was a <hi>preſent</hi> Reward, a Reward which was received even while the Work was doing, according to that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.11. <hi>In keeping them there is great reward.</hi> And this is agreeable to what fell out in the event. <hi>The Lord was with them,</hi> to proſper them, <hi>while they were with him;</hi> but when they forſook him, preſently Troubles overtook them. The pouring out of God's Fury on them to conſume them in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, being put in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20 13, 21. as the direct contrary to thoſe words, <hi>which if a Man do, he ſhall even live in them,</hi> ſeems greatly to favour this Notion. <hi>But the houſe of Iſrael rebelled againſt me in the Wilderneſs: They walked not in my Statutes, and they deſpiſed my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>Theſe Promiſes now inſiſted on, were promiſes of Reward to the obſervers of this firſt Covenant: But beſides theſe, there was another ſort of Promiſes exhibited in the firſt Covenant, and they were Promiſes of Pardon, in many caſes, when the Laws of that Covenant were broken. There were (as I have ſhewed) Laws of Indemnity, which made many of the breaches of the Laws of Duty, pardonable upon
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:151517:25"/> certain conditions. And ſuch were all Sins of Ignorance and Inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency; and ſome of thoſe alſo which were committed wittingly.

In ſome caſes, the offering of a Sin-offering, or Treſpaſs-offering, was the condition. In other caſes, that with confeſſion of Sin, was the condition.

                        </gap>o Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sin, between the firſt Covenant, and the Cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="1">1. They differ in the nature of thoſe Sacrifices by which Atonements were made, and upon which Forgiveneſs was promiſed. The Blood of the Sacrifice of the firſt Covenant was but <hi>the blood of Bulls and of Goats,</hi> and the like, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.4. But the Blood of the Sacrifice of the ſecond Covenant, is the Blood of Chriſt, the Eternal Son of God. So that the nature of the Sacrifices of the two Covenants, upon which the Promiſe of the pardon of Sins was granted, doth differ as much as the Blood of Beaſts and the Blood of the Son of God differ.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Thoſe two ſorts of Sacrifices pertaining to two kinds of Covenants, differ in the proportion of Efficacy and Virtue to accompliſh their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Ends and Effects. There is a greater Richneſs of proportion in the Blood of Chriſt to free the Conſcience from the guilt of Sin, or obligation to Eternal Puniſhment, than there was in the Blood of Beaſts to free the delinquent Perſon from temporal Puniſhments. This is plainly intimated in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13, 14. <hi>For if the blood of Bulls and of Goats, and the aſhes of an Heiſer ſprinkling the unclean, ſanctifieth to the purifying of the fleſh; [how much more] ſhall the Blood of Chriſt, who through the Eternal Spirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God, purge your Conſcience from dead works, to ſerve the living God?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. They differ in the nature of the pardon promiſed in each of the Covenants reſpectively. The Redemption granted in the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, was but Temporal, as the Covenant it ſelf was; it was but from Evils temporal: But Chriſt Jeſus, by his Atonement, <hi>hath obtained Eternal Redemption for us,</hi> Heb. 9.12.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:151517:25"/>4. They differ in reſpect of the Sins made pardonable by each Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant reſpectively. There were many ſins for which the firſt Covenant granted no Pardon, upon any terms whatſoever. <hi>They that deſpiſed Moſes</hi>'s <hi>Law, died without mercy,</hi> Heb. 10.28. But the Covenant of Grace makes promiſe of the pardon of the Greateſt Sins upon Repentance. <hi>All manner of Sin and Blaſphemy, except the Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> are pardonable upon Repentance. This difference is ſet down, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39. <hi>And by him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which ye could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes.</hi> We may well ſuppoſe, that the firſt Covenant did finally Condemn ſome, which the Covenant of Mercy Pardoned. <hi>David,</hi> in the matter of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> did that which was unpardonable by the firſt Covenant; it was a Fact to have been puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Death by the Law, but that there was none but God that could duly inflict it upon him, in his capacity; and yet, upon his Repentance, it was pardoned as to his Eternal Concerns, as well as Temporal, by virtue of God's Covenant of Mercy. On the other hand, a Man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably might be ſo Righteous in the Eye of the firſt Covenant, as not to be viſibly blameable, and yet even then be obnoxious to the Curſe of the Everlaſting Covenant. <hi>Paul,</hi> while he was <hi>Saul,</hi> and in the ſtate of Unbelief, was even then, <hi>as touching the righteouſneſs which is in the Law, blameleſs,</hi> as he himſelf ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6. So different were theſe two Covenants, that him whom the one Condemned, the other might Juſtifie; and likewiſe Juſtifie him, whom the other Condemned.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. They differed in reſpect of the condition to be performed on Man's part for the obtaining of pardon. Pardon was promiſed in the firſt Covenant upon condition of Doing only, without reference to Faith; but ſo are not the pardons of the New Covenant. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11.12. <hi>But that no man is juſtified by the Law in the ſight of God, it is evident; for the Juſt ſhall live by Faith: And the Law is not of Faith; but the man that doth them ſhall live in them.</hi> So much concerning the firſt Part of the Sanction of the firſt Covenant. Come we now to the ſecond.</p>
                     <p>The other part of the Sanction of this Covenant, did conſiſt in the Curſe of it denounced againſt the breakers of it. Though it's true, that every Man is under a Condemnation that would be Eternal, unleſs he comes to be abſolved by virtue of the Law of Grace; yet more than temporal Death was not expreſly threatned for breach of the Political Covenant, as ſuch.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For firſt, a violent Death inflicted by the hand of the Magiſtrate, for Capital Offences, is called the <hi>Curſe,</hi> Deut. 22.23. <hi>He that is hanged, is accurſed of God,</hi> or is the Curſe of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Chriſt who did not ſuffer Eternal Puniſhment for Man's Sin, did yet <hi>ſuffer the Curſe of the Law,</hi> in that he <hi>was hanged on a Tree,</hi> Gal. 3.13. It is true indeed, that by that temporary Sufferings of his, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us from Eternal Puniſhment, which we were obnoxious to.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thoſe who Apoſtatize from Chriſt, and reject his Goſpel, merit <hi>ſorer puniſhment</hi> than what was inflicted on them that <hi>deſpiſed Moſes</hi>'s <hi>Law;</hi> and yet ſorer Puniſhment (for kind) they cannot ſuffer, if Eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been the penalty of that Covenant, as ſuch, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.28, 29.</p>

                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:151517:26"/>4. As the Promiſes of that Covenant, when particularly expreſſed, did appear to be but temporal, ſo the Curſes of it appear to be no other in the particular enumeration of them. As for inſtance, a violent Death inflicted by the Hand of the Magiſtrate, was the puniſhment threatned for many Capital Offences; Such as was Idolatry, Blaſphemy, Witchcraft, Working on the Sabbath, invading the Prieſts Office, and for being a falſe Prophet; and alſo for Murder, Adultery, Sodomy, Buggery, Man-ſtealing, Curſing, or Smiting of Parents, or being ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornly Rebellious againſt them, and ſome other. And a cutting off from among the People, (whither by God's hand immediately, or by Man's, I determine not) was the penalty threatned for eating Leavened Bread within the time prohibited; for not Purifying ones ſelf, when Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean; for profaning holy things; for ones eating of the Sacrifice, with his Uncleanneſs upon him; for offering Sacrifice any where but at the Tabernacle; for eating of Blood, and for eating of the Fat of the Sacrifice; for neglecting to keep the Paſſover, and for not afflicting the Soul in the Day of general Atonement; and for ſeveral other Offences. And thoſe Offences, for which cutting off from among the People is threatned, being leſs criminous than the former, we have no reaſon to think the penalty of cutting off from among the People, to ſignifie more (if ſo much) than the ſuffering of a temporal Death. We may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> various Puniſhments are expreſt for their mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Crimes in the Wilderneſs, by <hi>God's overthrowing them in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> by Peſtilence, and otherwiſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</p>
                     <p>In brief, The temporal Evils threatned in this Covenant, were either Perſonal, Domeſtick, or National. The Perſonal and Domeſtick Evils, were no leſs, than whatſoever tended to the infelicity of Man's Life, as Diſeaſes in Body, Perplexity of Mind, Unfruitfulneſs in Body, in Cattel, in Ground; Scarcity, Poverty, Oppreſſion, loſs of Relations, fewneſs of Days, and an untimely cutting off from the Promiſed Land. The National were wild Beaſts, Peſtilence, Sword, Famine, Captivity, and ſuch like. Theſe were inflicted when the breach of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant became National in the generality of the People: But eſpecially, when thoſe who had the management of Publick Affairs, Civil and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick, did not reſtrain the People by a due Execution of Laws; but rather led them into ſin by their Example, and ſometimes by their Commands; corrupting Religion, and perverting Juſtice, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. And the Evils threatned being National, as the Covenant it ſelf was, they muſt needs be but Temporal; becauſe there is no Judging, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning, and Executing Nations, as Nations, but in this World.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Come we now to ſhew reaſon, why this Covenant is called the <hi>firſt</hi> Covenant, ſince there were others made before it; as that with <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and that Covenant of Salvation with <hi>Adam</hi> after his Fall, and with <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Abraham.</hi> And,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Negatively; It is not ſo called, as if it were the ſame for ſubſtance with that which was firſt made with <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> as many have thought, or becauſe it was propoſed upon the ſame terms. For,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That Covenant was eſtabliſhed upon the terms or condition of perfect Innocency; no proviſion being made in it for pardon, in caſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:151517:26"/> of failure, upon any condition whatſoever. But it was otherwiſe in this <hi>Moſaick</hi> Covenant, as I have ſhewed, in that it contained ſeveral Laws of Indemnity for the Relief of delinquent Perſons, upon certain poſſible and practicable Conditions.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If this and the Paradiſical-Covenant had been of the ſame nature, then it and the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Spiritual Seed, would have been inconſiſtent; the one promiſing Eternal Life upon Believing, the other only upon condition of ſinleſs Obedience. If this had been the caſe, the Law would have been againſt the Promiſe, which God forbid it ſhould, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. and the one would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the other, according to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s reaſoning. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. <hi>If by grace, then it is no more of works; otherwiſe grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace; otherwiſe work is no more work.</hi> But,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Affirmatively. It is called the <hi>firſt</hi> Covenant, becauſe it is the firſt of the two under queſtion and diſpute between the Apoſtles and unbelieving <hi>Jews.</hi> The Queſtion and Controverſie between them was, which of the two Covenants, that by <hi>Moſes,</hi> or that by Chriſt, was to be finally adhered to, as the way of Salvation. In the handling of which Controverſie, that by <hi>Moſes</hi> is called the firſt, and the Goſpel-Covenant eſtabliſhed by Chriſt, as was Propheſied by <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> is called the ſecond: Even as the one is called the Old Covenant, not becauſe it was the oldeſt of all Covenants, but becauſe oppoſed to that which was Propheſied of under the name of a New Covenant. It is obſervable, that where we meet with the firſt mention of the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant under that denomination, it is not ſtiled <hi>[the]</hi> firſt Covenant abſolutely, but <hi>[that]</hi> firſt Covenant, as pointing at that under Diſpute. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.7. <hi>For if (that) firſt Covenant had been faultleſs, then ſhould no place have been ſought for the ſecond.</hi>

They held Circumciſion in the Fleſh to be the condition in ſpecial, upon which all the Bleſſings of God's Covenant with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> were promiſed; but did not underſtand that Spiritual Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, <hi>viz.</hi> the Mortification of ſinful Affections and Luſts, was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally intended, when God made Circumciſion the condition of his Covenant. For they were it ſeems groſly ignorant of the neceſſity of Regeneration, and ſo of the Spiritual deſign of Circumciſion; which was the reaſon why <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> though a Ruler among the <hi>Jews,</hi> anſwered Chriſt ſo aukardly as he did, when he Preached to him the neceſſity of being <hi>born again,</hi> Joh. 3. An Ignorance that ſome allowance poſſibly might have been made for, had not the Circumciſion of the Heart, and the making themſelves a new Heart, been expreſly called for, as it was <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.16. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.31. Now this Ignorance of theirs in the Doctrine of the Circumciſion of the Heart, and the ſenſe they put upon God's making Circumciſion to be the condition of his Covenant of being their God, was doubtleſs the reaſon why they placed ſo very much as they did in Literal Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. For, although Circumciſion firſt given to <hi>Abraham</hi> by way of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, was afterwards incorporated with the body of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, yet it ſhould ſeem theſe <hi>Jews</hi> conſidered it not ſo much as it was a part of that Law, but chiefly as a Condition of God's Covenant with them in <hi>Abraham,</hi> as they were his Seed. And therefore, St. <hi>Paul</hi> where he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons up his Jewiſh Privileges, whil'ſt he was a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> puts Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion in the head of them all, and as accounted by him while a <hi>Phariſee</hi> a Privilege diſtinct from his <hi>being blameleſs, touching the Righteouſneſs which was in the Law,</hi> Phil. 3.5, 6. Whence alſo the Judaizers ſaid, <hi>it was needful to Circumciſe them, and to command them to keep the Law of Moſes,</hi> Acts 15.5, 24. As if Circumciſing did import ſomething different from, or at leaſt ſomething more, than keeping of the Law did, though otherwiſe it was a part of the Law. Upon this account doubtleſs it was, that we find them more zealous for Circumciſion, than for any other Point of the Law beſides.</p>
                     <p>Againſt this Erroneous Opinion of theirs, touching Literal Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions being the condition of the Spiritual Benefits of the Covenant, St. <hi>Saul</hi> argueth ſeveral ways. Firſt, By maintaining that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant did chiefly reſpect Circumciſion in the Spirit. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. <hi>He is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that Circumciſion, which is outward in the fleſh,</hi> (that is, it was not that Circumciſion which would ſavingly avail them, as they thought it would) <hi>but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and Circumciſion is that of the Heart, in the Spirit, and not in the Letter; whoſe praiſe is not of Men, but of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, by ſhewing that <hi>Abraham</hi> could not have been Juſtified before Circumciſion, if the great Benefits of the Covenant (of which Ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication was one) were ſuſpended upon that as a neceſſary condition. And yet that he was Juſtified, vvhen not Circumciſed, there is the expreſs Authority of Scripture for. This he aſſerts. Rom. 4.9, 10. <hi>For we ſay that Faith was reckoned to Abraham for Righteouſneſs. How was it then reckoned? when he was in Circumciſion, or in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion?</hi> Not <hi>in Circumciſion, but in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:151517:28"/>
                     <p>Afterwards, he proceeds to undeceive them in the apprehenſion they had, that the Benefits of the Covenant were entailed upon <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Natural Seed as ſuch; or at leaſt as ſuch, with the addition of a Literal obſervation of Circumciſion, and the Law, without reſpect to the Spiritual and New Birth: <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6, 7, 8. <hi>They are not all Iſrael, which are of Iſrael,</hi> (as they thought they were) <hi>neither becauſe they are the Seed of Abraham, are they all Children: But in Iſaac ſhall thy Seed be called:</hi> That is, thoſe ſhall be called <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, which are born as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was, by Faith in the Promiſe, which are therefore called <hi>Children of the Promiſe.</hi> For ſo the Apoſtle expounds it, ſaying, <hi>They which are the Children of the fleſh, theſe are not the Children of God; but the Children of the Promiſe are counted for the Seed;</hi> to wit, ſuch as are <hi>born after the Spirit,</hi> as it is explained, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.28, 29. And this agrees to what he had ſaid before, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28. <hi>He is not a Jew, which is one outwardly,</hi> &amp;c. Againſt which corrupt Opinion, <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> did oppoſe himſelf, when he admoniſhed the <hi>Phariſees, to bring forth fruit meet for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and think not to ſay within your ſelves, we have Abraham to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Mat. 3.7, 8.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle labours to cure this grand Error about Literal Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion as disjoyned from Spiritual, in many other places; and ſhew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, how that Circumciſion <hi>availeth nothing,</hi> but <hi>a New Creature,</hi> ſuch as Spiritual Circumciſion makes a Man to be. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15. <hi>Not Circumciſion, but Faith.</hi> Gal. 5.6. <hi>Not Circumciſion, but keeping the Commandments,</hi> is that which would only reach thoſe great Ends which they ſought after in Literal Circumciſion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.19. But I ſhall have occaſion to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove theſe Scriptures further upon another Head of this Diſcourſe. And by the way, we may obſerve, that thoſe who build their hopes of future Happineſs upon their having been Baptized, and their being of the Church, without the inward Grace ſignified by Baptiſm, which is the <hi>waſhing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> they are much a-kin to thoſe miſerable miſtaken <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. They not underſtanding the Typical and Spiritual uſe of the Legal Sacrifices, as they did prefigure the Death and Suffering of Chriſt, and the general Atonement which was to be made thereby, nor yet the Predictions of the Prophets touching his Death, they ran into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother groſs Error, and that was, That the promiſed <hi>Meſſias ſhould not, by ſuffering death, become a Sacrifice for ſin.</hi> And therefore they ſaid to him, when he ſpoke to them of his Death; <hi>We have heard out of the Law, that Chriſt abideth for ever; and how ſayeſt thou the Son of Man muſt be lift up?</hi> Joh. 12.34. They did not dream of his Dying, but of his Reigning viſibly as a Mighty Monarch among them, and ſubduing all Nations under them; <hi>Becauſe they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the Prophets which are read every Sabbath-day, they have fulfilled them in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning him,</hi> Acts 13.27. Their Ignorance in the meaning of the Types and Predictions touching the Death of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> would have been the more excuſable, if they had not wilfully and obſtinately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in that Error after thoſe Types and Prophecies were fulfilled and explained to them. Ignorance in this matter was found in Chriſt's own Diſciples a great while; but their ſlowneſs to believe thoſe Types
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:151517:29"/> and Prophecies after they were fulfilled, was a thing which our Saviour rebuked them for, ſaying, <hi>O fools, and ſlow of heart, to believe all that the Prophets have ſpoken. Ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things, and to enter into his glory?</hi> Luke 24.25, 26. But the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> were tenacious of this Opinion, after they had ſufficient means to have been convinc'd of their Error in it. In oppoſition to which Opinion, the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> argues at large the neceſſity of Chriſt's Suffering by Death. As firſt, he argues it from his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. For having proved him, according to Prophecy, to be a Prieſt, not after the Order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> but of <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> and ſo a Prieſt of greater Dignity, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. and 7. He infers, <hi>Chap</hi> 8. that as a Prieſt, he muſt have ſomething to Offer in Sacrifice, and that of greater value than what was Offered by Prieſts under the Law, that were but of an inferiour Order; and that he ſhews to have been Himſelf, and his own Blood, as the Antitype of all thoſe Legal Sacrifices, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. Secondly, He proves his Death neceſſary for the confirmation of the ſecond and New Covenant, as he was Mediator of it. As <hi>the firſt Teſtament was not dedicated without Blood,</hi> ſo neither is the ſecond: <hi>For where a Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there of neceſſity muſt alſo be the death of the Teſtator,</hi> Chap. 9.15,-23. Thirdly, His Death was neceſſary for the obtaining of Remiſſion of Sins; a Benefit promiſed in the New Covenant: <hi>For without ſhedding of Blood</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there is no Remiſſion of Sin,</hi> Chap. 9.22. with Chap. 10.5-18.</p>
                     <p>And indeed, it was a good part of the Apoſtle's work to beat down this Opinion, that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was not to dye. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.3. St. <hi>Paul, as his manner was, went into them; and three Sabbath-days reaſoned with them out of the Scriptures, opening and alledging that Chriſt muſt needs have ſuffered and riſen again from the dead.</hi> Yea, this Opinion had ſo generally obtained among them in our Saviour's time, that it ſeems the Apoſtles of Chriſt at firſt were not free from it. For when our Saviour told them, that at <hi>Jeruſalem he ſhould be delivered to the Gentiles, and that they ſhould ſcourge him, and put him to death, and that the third day he ſhould riſe again;</hi> it's ſaid, <hi>they underſtood none of theſe things, and that this ſaying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were ſpoken:</hi> Though they were ſpoken plainly, and in no Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.32, 33, 34. Chriſt's being Crucified, <hi>became a ſtumbling-block to the Jews</hi> through this Error of theirs, and that which they inſiſted upon, as a Reaſon why they would not receive him as the Chriſt of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They held another Error which probably was Mother or Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the former, and that was, That the Legal Sacrifices did expiate and take away Sin, not only ſo as to free them from Legal Penalties and Temporal Puniſhments, as in many caſes they did; but ſo alſo as to free them from all obligation to Eternal Puniſhment. And ſo they did attribute to thoſe Sacrifices, the ſame atoning Virtue and purging Efficacy, as is proper only to the Blood of Chriſt. In oppoſition to this Opinion, it is maintain'd,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That thoſe Legal Sacrifices, were but Figures of the great Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10, 11, 12. and 10.1.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:151517:29"/>2. It was argued, that it was <hi>impoſſible that the blood of Bulls and of Goats ſhould take away Sin,</hi> becauſe theſe were offered year after year, over and over in the day of general Atonement for the ſame ſins. And that if the former Sacrifices which were firſt offered, had taken away ſin, the latter could not have been neceſſary to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3, 11. The often repetition of Sacrifices for the ſame ſins, argues that the Worſhippers had a ſecret ſenſe in their Conſcience, that thoſe Sacrifices were not of a competent Value, nor a ſufficient Price to Redeem their Souls from Sin, as it expoſeth to Eternal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; however, they might <hi>ſanctifie as to the purifying of the fleſh,</hi> yet they could not <hi>make any perfect as pertaining to the Conſcience,</hi> Heb. 9.9. and 10.1, 2.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It was argued from a Prophetical paſſage in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. in which Chriſt is brought in ſpeaking thus; <hi>Sacrifice and Offering thou would'ſt not, but a Body haſt thou prepared me: In burnt Offerings and Sacrifice for ſin thou haſt had no pleaſure: Then ſaid I, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God.</hi> From whence he infers, that the firſt ſort of Sacrifices <hi>were taken away</hi> as inſufficient, <hi>that the ſecond might be eſtabliſhed. By the which will,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we are ſanctified through the offering of the Body of Jeſus once for all,</hi> Heb. 10.5.—10.</p>
                     <p>This Opinion of theirs, that Legal Sacrifices did expiate all their Sins, did keep up in them a hope of Impunity here and hereafter, under many Immoralities and great Tranſgreſſions in the courſe of their Lives. Though they multiplied Tranſgreſſion, yet if they multiplied Sacrifices too, they thought they ſhould eſcape well enough. <hi>Amos</hi> 4.4, 5. <hi>Come to Bethel and tranſgreſs, at Gilgal multiply tranſgreſſion, and bring your Sacrifice every morning, and your Tythes after three years, and offer a ſacrifice of thankſgiving with Leaven, and proclaim and publiſh your free-Offerings, for this liketh you, O Children of Iſrael, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> And much after this rate do carnal Chriſtians bear up themſelves in hopes that all their ſins are done away by the Sacrifice of Chriſt the Lamb of God that taketh away the Sins of the World, though they live from day to day in ungodlineſs. Only indeed they ſin at a cheaper rate for the preſent, than the wicked <hi>Jews</hi> did. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſinners were at the coſt of many a Sacrifice to ſtop the mouth of Conſcience; but theſe are at coſt only in <hi>making proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfil the luſts thereof,</hi> and depend upon Chriſt to pay all their Scores.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Another of their Errors, as conſequent upon the former, was this; That without Circumciſion and obſerving of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Gentiles</hi> could not be ſaved. This Opinion the Judaizing Chriſtians retained after their Converſion to the Chriſtian Profeſſion. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.1, 5, 24. <hi>Certain men which came down from Judea taught the brethren, ſaying, Except ye be Circumciſed after the manner of Moſes, ye cannot be ſaved. There roſe up certain of the Sect of the Phariſees which believed, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it was needful to Circumciſe them and to command them to keep the Law of Moſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In oppoſition to which Opinion, St. <hi>Paul</hi> taught that the <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God by Faith without the Law is manifeſted unto all, and upon all that believe, whether Jews or Gentiles, and that there is no difference,</hi>
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:151517:30"/> Rom. 3.21, 22. And that a Man <hi>is juſtified by Faith without the deeds of the Law,</hi> though never Circumciſed: And that <hi>God is the God of the Gentiles,</hi> as well <hi>as of the Jews,</hi> and that <hi>he doth juſtifie the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion and the Circumciſion;</hi> thoſe that had obſerved the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and thoſe that had not, upon the ſame terms, <hi>viz.</hi> of Evangelical Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28, 29, 30. Whereunto agrees the words of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 15.9, 11. <hi>He put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by Faith; i. e.</hi> us <hi>Jews,</hi> and they <hi>Gentiles: But we believe that through the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, we ſhall be ſaved even as they,</hi> and upon no other terms, though we have obſerved the Law, and they have not, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.15, 16. Upon the ſame account St. <hi>Paul</hi> again affirms, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. <hi>That to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his Faith is counted for Righteouſneſs.</hi> That is, the Idolatrous <hi>Gentiles</hi> that never had obſerved the Law, but lived <hi>without God in the World,</hi> ſhould yet have their practical belief of the Goſpel imputed even to them for Righteouſneſs. And he further exemplifies this in <hi>Abraham,</hi> Ver. 9.10, 11, 12. whoſe Faith was reckoned to him for Righteouſneſs before he was Circumciſed, that he might be the Patern and great Example of God's juſtifying the Heathen upon their believing and obeying as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, in leaving his Idolatry and his Country upon God's Promiſe and Command, though he never had been Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed. And upon the like account he ſaith again, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8, 9. <hi>That the Scripture foreſeeing that God would juſtifie the Heathen through Faith, preached before the Goſpel unto Abraham, ſaying, In thee ſhall all Nations be bleſſed.</hi> And from thence he concludes, that thoſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> that <hi>be of Faith,</hi> that believe as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, <hi>are bleſſed as Abraham was, are bleſſed with faithful Abraham.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Another Error which was held by ſome Judaizing Chriſtians was this; That Faith in Chriſt and Literal Circumciſion, with a Literal obſervation of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> jointly, were the Condition of Juſtification. Though they were ſuch as Believed, yet they taught, that except Men were Circumciſed, and kept the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> they could not be ſaved, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.1, 5. They ſeem to have retained the ſame falſe Opinion of Juſtification by the Law, as the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> did, but held the Death of Chriſt neceſſary to be ſuper-added.</p>
                     <p>To convince them of which Error, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſets before them the bad conſequence of it in two reſpects. 1. In that they hereby rendred the Death of Chriſt needleſs in it ſelf. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21. <hi>If Righteouſneſs come by the Law, then Chriſt is dead in vain:</hi> There would then have been no need of Chriſt's Death to accompliſh it, as the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> indeed did hold. 2. In that this Opinion of theirs made Chriſt and his Death uſeleſs unto them, and cut them off from receiving any benefit by him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2, 4. <hi>Behold, I Paul ſay unto you, that if you be Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing: Chriſt is become of none effect unto you: whoſoever of you are juſtified by the Law, ye are fallen from Grace,</hi> And hereto agrees that in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.10. <hi>We have an Altar whereof they have no right to eat which ſerve the Tabernacle:</hi> Thoſe Judaizers who ſtand for the neceſſity of Moſaic Obſervations, have no right to, nor ſhall
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:151517:30"/> receive benefit by Chriſt, who is the only Chriſtian Altar to which we bring all our Sacrifices.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. They held the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> to be unalterable, and of perpetual obligation. In oppoſition to which, the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves to great purpoſe that Propheſie, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31, 32. <hi>Behold, the days come, ſaith the Lord, that I will make a new Covenant with the houſe of Iſrael, and the houſe of Judah: Not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For in that he ſaith, a new Covenant, he hath</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>made the firſt old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old, is ready</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to vaniſh away.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews how that the Legal Miniſtration, how glorious ſoever it was, was yet done away, when that which was far more glorious did appear, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7, 11. And again, <hi>that we are become dead to the Law by the Body of Chriſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the Law,</hi> Rom. 7.4, 6.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The laſt of their Errors I ſhall inſiſt on, was this: They held the firſt Covenant as alone, or ſeparated, to be the Covenant of Salvation, only taking in with it the Covenant of Literal Circumciſion, which alſo was made a part of their Law. That firſt Covenant which I have already deſcribed as a Temporal Covenant, and the Promiſes and the Threatnings of it but Temporal, they took to be eſtabliſhed for perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity, and the Promiſes of it to contain Promiſes of Eternal Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, or Remiſſion, as well as Temporal; and Eternal Life and Felicity as well as Temporal: And ſuch a Literal obſervation of the Laws of it to be the condition of thoſe Promiſes, as would render them inculpable in the eye of the Magiſtracy; ſuch a Righteouſneſs ſufficient to juſtifie them before God, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith he had while he was a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> Phil. 3.6. <hi>As touching the Righteouſneſs which is in the Law blameleſs;</hi> which then he accounted to be his gain.</p>
                     <p>Now that they did peremptorily adhere to this firſt Covenant, and the terms of it, for Juſtification and Eternal Life, it doth plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the mighty oppoſition which the Apoſtle made againſt them in it. For they did ſtill oppoſe another Covenant, as the Covenant of Juſtification and Eternal Life, unto this Moſaical Covenant; and Faith, as the Conditon of that, in oppoſition to Works as the Condition of this, as will appear if we come to Inſtances.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. St. <hi>Paul</hi> argues it with them, that the Promiſe of God to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his Seed, <hi>was not through the Law, but through the righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi> Rom. 4.13. Not through the Law, that is, not upon the terms upon which the benefits of the firſt Covenant were promiſed to the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but upon quite other terms, expreſs'd by the Righteouſneſs of Faith.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He argues it farther with them, That God's way of accounting Men Righteous by Faith, and their way of ſeeking Righteouſneſs upon the terms of the firſt Covenant, were utterly inconſiſtent, and the one deſtructive of the other, and that but one of theſe ways could poſſibly ſtand. <hi>For if they which are of the Law be Heirs, Faith is made void, and the Promiſe made of none effect,</hi> Rom. 4.14. And again, <hi>If the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance be of the Law, it is no more of Promiſe: But God gave it to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:151517:31"/> Abraham by Promiſe,</hi> Gal. 3.18. <hi>And if by Grace, then it is no more of Works, otherwiſe Grace is no more Grace,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And that the Law did not exclude the Promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> he farther argues, in that the Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> was confirmed, and unalterably ſetled and eſtabliſhed in the <hi>Meſſias</hi> 430 Years before the Law by <hi>Moſes</hi> was given, and that therefore for them to go about to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the Law in the room of the Promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> ſo confirmed, would be as unreaſonable and unjuſt, as for one Man to alter or make void anothers Covenant, after he hath confirmed it. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.15, 17. <hi>Brethren, I ſpeak after the manner of men: though it be but a Mans Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, yet if it be confirmed, no Man diſannulleth or addeth thereto. And this I ſay, that the Covenant that was confirmed before of God in Chriſt, the Law which was</hi> 430 <hi>Years after, cannot diſannul, that it ſhould make the Promiſe of none effect.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. St. <hi>Paul</hi> argues it impoſſible in the nature of the thing, that they ſhould be juſtified by the Law, becauſe one main end of God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulging the Law of Nature, (which yet was a great part of the firſt Covenant) was to convince Men of their Guilt, and of their obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to Wrath, and to ſtop their Mouthes, and to leave them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any plea of defence as from it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19, 20. <hi>Now we know that what things ſoever the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them who are under the Law: That every mouth may be ſtopt, and all the world may become guilty before God. Therefore by the deeds of the Law, there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight: for by the Law is the knowledge of ſin.</hi> And if the Law doth convict Men, it cannot juſtifie them: For the ſame Law cannot both Condemn and Juſtifie the ſame perſon, in reference to the ſame Charge. If all are Caſt and Condemned by the Original Law, as they are, (<hi>for he hath concluded all under ſin, that he might have mercy upon all,</hi> Gal. 3.) then ſo many as come to be juſtified after this, muſt needs be juſtified by another Law ſuperceding that, and that is none other than the Law of Grace. The Law of Nature Curſeth every one that hath broken it, though but once, and therefore it cannot juſtifie them too: <hi>Out of the ſame mouth</hi> (in this caſe) <hi>doth not proceed Bleſſing and Curſing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. He argues this Opinion of theirs to be contrary to the Doctrine of the Prophets many hundred years after, as well as contrary to the Promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> long before the Law. <hi>That no man is juſtified by the Law in the ſight of God, it is evident: For the juſt ſhall live by Faith: and the Law is not of Faith; but the man that doth them, ſhall live in them,</hi> Gal. 3.11, 12. from <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4. The Law is not of Faith, that is, it doth not promiſe Pardon, or any other Bleſſing upon Believing, but upon condition of Doing the things therein required: <hi>the man that doth them, ſhall live in them,</hi> Levit. 18.5.</p>

That <hi>the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was faulty,</hi> or defective, or elſe there would have been <hi>no place ſought for a ſecond,</hi> ver. 7. 3. That the Promiſes of that firſt Covenant were not of ſuch things as Men ſtand in need of, to make them ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly Happy, as thoſe better Promiſes of the ſecond Covenant are, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. 4. And yet more particularly, that in this New Covenant, there is promiſe of ſuch a forgiveneſs of ſins, as that <hi>iniquity ſhall be remembred no more,</hi> ver. 12. whereas the firſt Covenant did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe any ſuch Pardons: All that it promiſed, was a forgiveneſs only as to the concerns of this Life, otherwiſe their ſins were ſtill kept upon the File to be taken away (if ever taken away) by the <hi>Mediator of the New Teſtament, by means of his Death, for the redemption of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions that were under the firſt Teſtament,</hi> Chap. 9.15. But in thoſe Sacrifices, (which were but the Sacrifices of the firſt Covenant) <hi>there was a remembrance again made of ſins every year,</hi> Heb. 10.3.</p>
                     <p>And now, by all theſe reaſonings of the Apoſtle put together, it ſufficiently appears that the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> did expect Juſtification and Eternal Life, only upon the terms of the firſt Covenant, and that they held that Covenant, as comprehending the Covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, to be the Covenant of Eternal Life. And indeed, this laſt mentioned Error of theirs, in holding the firſt Covenant to be the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Salvation, did in a manner contain in it all the reſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, which did naturally grow out of it. For if that had been the Covenant of Salvation, then it would have followed, that the Sacrifices of that Covenant had been ſufficient, and the Death of Chriſt needleſs; and that Circumciſion and keeping the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> would have been neceſſary to the Salvation of the <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And now after all this, conſidering what Erroneous Opinions the incredulous <hi>Jews</hi> held about the Law, and about Circumciſion; and conſidering in what ſenſe they aſſerted Juſtification by the Law, and by Circumciſion, it will be no difficult thing to underſtand exactly, in what ſenſe the Apoſtle doth every where deny Juſtification to be by the Law, or by the Works of the Law.</p>
                     <p>For doubtleſs St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s denial of Juſtification and Salvation to be by the Law, or Works of the Law, is to be underſtood in the very ſame ſenſe in which the incredulous <hi>Jews,</hi> againſt whom he Diſputed, did hold theſe to be attainable thereby. For elſe, his Reaſonings would have been beſide the Queſtion under debate between them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt take our meaſure of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſenſe in the Negative part of the Queſtion, by his Adverſaries ſenſe of it in the Affirmative. And if ſo, then in his denying Juſtification and Salvation to be by the Law, or by Works of the Law, we muſt underſtand him to deny a freedom from the Eternal Puniſhment to be attainable by Legal Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices: And alſo to deny that the, promiſe of Eternal Life was made upon condition of Literal Circumciſion, and a Literal obſervation of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, without being by Faith renewed in the inward frame and moral conſtitution of the Soul: and likewiſe, to deny Eternal Life to be attainable by the terms of their Political Covenant, the Promiſes whereof were not made upon condition of Believing, but of Doing.

                        <hi>The Law is not of Faith, but the man that doth thoſe things, ſhall live in them,</hi> Gal. 3.12. For theſe and ſuch-like were the Opinions which thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> did hold, (as I have ſhewed) and theſe were the things in which St. <hi>Paul</hi> oppoſed them. They divided and ſeparated Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion and the Law in the Letter of them, from the Spirit of them both; claiming Juſtification by the Letter alone. And they divided the Law from the Promiſe rightly underſtood, and looked to be Juſtified by Works of the Law, without Faith in the Promiſe rightly underſtood. They looked for the <hi>Meſſias</hi> indeed, but not to become a Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Sin, or to eſtabliſh a New Covenant of Salvation, but to further their Temporal and Eternal Felicity in the way of their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Political Law.</p>
                     <p>But then it doth not in the leaſt appear, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in denying Juſtification to be by the Law in the ſenſe thus explained, doth alſo thereby deny Works of ſincere Obedience to God, to concur with Faith in Man's Juſtification in all reſpects.</p>
                     <p>And if any ſhall yet ſuppoſe, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in denying Juſtification by Works, in the <hi>Jews</hi> corrupt ſenſe, doth alſo, on the by, deny all Works of Evangelical Obedience to bear any part of the Condition on which God promiſeth to juſtifie Men through Chriſt; ſuch a Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if admitted, would make his Doctrine herein inconſiſtent, not only with the Faith of the holy Men of Old, who were wont to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Condition of the Covenant of Mercy, by loving God, and keeping his Commandments; but it would alſo make him inconſiſtent with himſelf and his own Doctrine, and the Doctrine of other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as I doubt not but plainly to make appear, before I have done with this Diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>There is one Character of Works given, by which you may certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know what Works they were which St. <hi>Paul</hi> denied Men were juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by; and they were ſuch Works which were apt to occaſion boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Not of Works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi> Rom. 4.2. <hi>For if Abraham were juſtified by Works,</hi> (to wit, in the <hi>Jews</hi> ſenſe, by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion in the Fleſh, to which St. <hi>Paul</hi> alludes, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.) <hi>he hath where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to glory, but not before God,</hi> but only before Men, who were not Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed as he was. For the unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> who ſought and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Juſtification by Circumciſion, and other Legal Obſervations, did glory over the poor <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that were deſtitute of thoſe Works, which conſiſted in the outward Privileges which the <hi>Jews</hi> had, and looked down upon them with contempt, though ſome of them were much better than themſelves, ſuch as <hi>Cornelius,</hi> whom they looked upon as unclean. This boaſting humor of the <hi>Jews</hi> over the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed and reproved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. from <hi>ver.</hi> 17. to 29. Now the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith, of obtaining pardon by anothers Undertaking for us, to wit, Chriſt Jeſus, and of being accepted with God through him, upon our ſincere, though otherwiſe imperfect Obedience, (which ſincere Obedience too, is not performed without his ſpecial Grace and Aſſiſtance) takes away all occaſion of boaſting, in reference both to God and Men, and laid the <hi>Jews</hi> as low as the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and made St. <hi>Peter</hi> a <hi>Jew</hi> to ſay, <hi>But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jeſus

Thus Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating Grace made <hi>David</hi> ſo far from boaſting, either of Privileges, or of his Performances, that he ſaid unto God, <hi>Who am I? and what is my people, that we ſhould be able to offer ſo willingly after this ſort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee,</hi> 1 Chron. 29.14. This made St. <hi>Paul</hi> to ſay, <hi>We are not ſufficient of our ſelves, as of our ſelves, to think any thing, but our ſufficiency is of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.5. And <hi>by the grace of God, I am what I am,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. And <hi>of him are we in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us, Wiſdom, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Sanctification, and Redemption, that he that gloriet h, may glory in the Lord,</hi> having nothing but what he hath received from: him <hi>gratis,</hi> and without all deſert, yea contrary to his demerits, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30, 31. The <hi>good Works</hi> which the Saints do, they do them by vertue of their being <hi>created in Chriſt Jeſus</hi> in order thereunto, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.10. and all that is good, <hi>is through Chriſt ſtrengthening them,</hi> Phil. 4.13. From whence therefore we may well conclude, that if the Works which St. <hi>Paul</hi> wholly excludes in the matter of Juſtification, were only ſuch as were apt to occaſion boaſting, that then Acts of Evangeſical Obedience were none of thoſe Works.</p>
                     <p>According to the ſenſe explained then, I preſume we may well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. which of all others ſeems in the Phraſe and Expreſſion to be moſt Excluſive of Works in the point of Juſtification; the Words are theſe, <hi>Therefore we conclude, that a man is juſtified by Faith, without the deeds of the Law.</hi> Which words (if you conſider the context) ſeem to import no more but this, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Man is juſtified in the Goſpel-way, which in the verſe before is called <hi>the Law of Faith:</hi> And not by the deeds of the Law, or upon the terms of the firſt Covenant, which in the verſe before likewiſe is called <hi>the Law of Works.</hi> Which two, the Goſpel-terms, and the firſt Covenant-terms, are ſtill oppoſed to each other in the point of Juſtification. Now although the concluſion here laid down is true, in reference to the <hi>Jews</hi> as well as to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> yet it ſeems to be written here with ſpecial reference to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Intimating, that upon their Belief, they might be Juſtified, without turning Proſelytes to the Jewiſh way, as appears by that Interrogation in the very next words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>ver.</hi> 29.30. <hi>Is he the God of the Jews only?

                     <p n="1">1.

                     <p n="2">2. It vvas called their ovvn Righteouſneſs, becauſe they did not think Regeneration, or Supernatural Grace neceſſary to the obtaining
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:151517:34"/> of it, but a Literal obſervation of the Lavv and Circumciſion, ſuch as paſſed for a Righteouſneſs among Men, and ſuch as they, vvithout Supernatural Aid, vvere able to perform. As for thoſe Precepts vvhich commanded the loving of God vvith all the Heart, and the Circumciſing the Heart, becauſe theſe vvere not enjoyned under expreſs penalties, as thoſe things vvere of vvhich the Rulers vvere to take cognizance, therefore the <hi>Phariſees</hi> counted them but <hi>Counſels</hi> only, and not direct Precepts. But the Chriſtians-Righteouſneſs, vvhich is by Faith, may be ſaid to be of God, becauſe <hi>by Grace they are ſaved through Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, and that not of themſelves, it is the gift of God: And we are his Workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Epheſ. 2.8, 10.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It vvas called their ovvn Righteouſneſs, becauſe it vvas a vvay of ſeeking to be juſtified of their ovvn deviſing, and not of God's appointing.

                     <p>The reſult of all then is, That they were the Works of the Law, as excluſive of Faith in Chriſt and his Death; which the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied any Man to be juſtified by; and not thoſe Works of the Law, which are the immediate effects of Faith in Chriſt, in his Death, and in his Doctrine.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> How St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith, and not by Works, was then miſtaken by ſome.</head>
                     <p>I Come in the next place to ſhew how that St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Reaſonings about Faith and Works, in reference to Juſtification, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably miſtaken by ſuch Solifidians as St. <hi>James</hi> reaſoned againſt. For he having taught that God did juſtifie the ungodly <hi>Gentiles</hi> upon their Believing, and without the deeds of the Law, but denying Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to as many of the <hi>Jews</hi> as did not Believe, though they were obſervers of the Law; there were ſome who thereupon through miſtake, laid the whole ſtreſs of Salvation upon Believing, to the neglect of a holy and virtuous Life. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> being ſenſible how apt ſome were to make a bad uſe of his good Doctrine, and to draw bad Concluſions out of good Premiſes, he frequently mentions ſuch Inferences, on purpoſe to caution Men againſt them. As for Inſtance: He having ſaid in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. <hi>That where ſin abounded, grace did abound much more:</hi> In Chap. 6.1. he ſaith, <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? ſhall we continue in ſin, that grace may abound?</hi> as ſome it ſeems were ready to infer; <hi>God forbid,</hi> ſaith he; <hi>how ſhall we that are dead to ſin, live any longer therein?</hi> You may conſult to like purpoſe in general, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.5.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:151517:35"/> 6, 7, 31. &amp; 6.15. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.17. and find that St. <hi>Paul</hi> and others were <hi>ſlanderouſly reported to have ſaid, Let us do evil, that good may come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That there were ſuch as did miſrepreſent St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's Grace and Long-ſuffering, and wreſt ſeveral paſſages in his Epiſtles, and other Scriptures, to their own deſtruction, we are told by St. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15, 16. <hi>And account that the long-ſuffering of the Lord is Salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul alſo, according to the wiſdom given him, hath written unto you; as alſo in all his Epiſtles, ſpeaking in them of theſe things: In which are ſome things hard to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, which they that are unlearned and unſtable wreſt, as they do alſo the other Scriptures to their own deſtruction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And after St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2, 3, 4, 5, verſes, had by many black Characters, deſcribed a ſort of Chriſtians that had <hi>a form of godlineſs, but denied the power thereof:</hi> In ver. 8. he further deſcribes them by that which was the cauſe of the forementioned unſavoury fruits of the Fleſh, to wit, that they <hi>were men of corrupt minds</hi> or <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, and reprobate concerning the Faith,</hi> or void of Judgment concerning the Faith, as the Margin hath it. They were Men of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Principles, and injudicious concerning the Doctrine of Faith: They did not diſcern Faith to be neceſſary in the operative and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical nature of it: But as they did ſatisfie themſelves with a form of Godlineſs without the power: ſo they did likewiſe with a formal inefficacious and liveleſs Faith, which made them ſo unſavoury in their Lives.</p>
                     <p>And St. <hi>John,</hi> after he had in his firſt Epiſtle antidoted the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians againſt the pretentions of the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> who held a bad Life conſiſtent with Communion with God through illumination of mind, and the Chriſtian Faith, deceiving themſelves, and labouring to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others, in thinking they might be Righteous without doing Righteouſneſs, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.7. He towards the concluſion of that Epiſtle, ſums up his general ſcope in it in theſe words: <hi>Theſe things have I written unto you that believe in the Name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have Eternal Life, and that ye may believe on the Name of the Son of God,</hi> Chap. 5.13. His meaning is, as I conceive, that he wrote this Epiſtle, firſt, to the end they might be the better aſſured of Salvation by Chriſt upon their rightly Believing on him. And ſecondly, To the end they might not be drawn into miſtakes in the point of Believing, as if any Faith leſs than ſuch as is accompanied with a conſtant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to Chriſt's Doctrine and Example touching a holy Life, would give them that Aſſurance. He wrote to them that did Believe, that they might Believe; that is, that they might Believe yet more under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandingly, more groundedly, and ſo perſeveringly againſt all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Apoſtacy from the profeſſion of the Faith, or to looſneſs in the profeſſion of it.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Jude</hi> alſo, <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4. ſtirred up the Chriſtians to <hi>contend earneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:151517:35"/> Goſpel, as if it had been a Proclamation from Heaven of a general Pardon for Chriſt's ſake, and through Faith in him, of as many ſins as Men had a mind to commit. The which Error, led them into thoſe Monſtrous Impieties charged upon them in that Epiſtle: By reaſon of which, <hi>the way of Truth,</hi> the right Faith they pretended to, <hi>was evil-ſpoken of</hi> in the World, (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> notes) they being indeed <hi>Spots and Blemiſhes</hi> to the Chriſtians and Chriſtian-profeſſion, ſo long as they were admitted to their Feaſts of Charity, as owned by them to be of their Number. This was indeed an ungodly Faith: But the Faith which he exhorted them to contend for, and to <hi>build up themſelves upon,</hi> as on a ſure Foundation, he calls <hi>their moſt holy Faith,</hi> verſ. 20. ſuch a Faith as is an Operative Principle of a holy Life.</p>
                     <p>And they were ſuch Chriſtians as St. <hi>James</hi> in his Epiſtle did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate with, that did lean ſo much upon a meer Believing, upon a meer Aſſent of the mind unto the truth of certain Propoſitions, as that they were careleſs in the ſubduing of their Paſſions, and bridling their Tongues, and regulating their Actions; as if theſe had not been neceſſary to Salvation: But thought themſelves ſafe upon account of their barren Faith, though they were Proud and Conceited of their Knowledge and Attainments, Cenſorious and Contentious, Unmercifull and Uncharitable. In a word, they were ſuch as were injudicious concerning the Faith that will Save, and under miſtakes of the Apoſtles Doctrine about it. All this will eaſily appear to any that ſhall but with a competent meaſure of Underſtanding, view and conſider the ſcope and contents of that Epiſtle.</p>
                     <p>And thus you ſee how plainly it appears by the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles, that the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith, without Works, in the ſenſe in which the Apoſtles aſſerted it, was miſunderſtood by many <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> carnal Goſpellers, or <hi>Solifidians.</hi> The ſenſe in which the Apoſtles did aſſert it, was, that Faith juſtifies without Works Antecedent to Believing, and without Works, as the Works of a literal obſervation of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, which was oppoſed by the <hi>Jews</hi> to Faith, as having Chriſt Crucified for its Object, and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Regeneration, and ſincere Obedience in a holy Life, for its inſeparable Effects. But theſe deceived Souls, that <hi>deceived their own Hearts,</hi> ſeem to have underſtood the Apoſtles, as if they had taught Juſtification by Faith, conſidered only as having the Death of Chriſt and the Atonement made thereby, for its Object, without reſpect to Regeneration and new Obedience, as any part of the Condition.</p>
                     <p>And it had been much better for the Chriſtian World, if thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Notions about the Doctrine of Faith as Juſtifying, had died with thoſe Men, which in the firſt Ages of the Chriſtian-Church were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with them. But alas, it is too apparent, that the ſame, or much of the ſame dangerous and deſtructive miſtakes, have been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, or revived in theſe latter Ages of the Church. For we find by experience in this preſent Age, that very many of thoſe who are called Chriſtians, preſume themſelves to be Chriſtians indeed, and ſuch as ſhall be ſaved by Chriſt, though their Lives declare them to be far from being <hi>New Creatures,</hi> from being <hi>renewed in the Spirit of

For they are confident they Believe all the Articles of their Creed; and in doing ſo, they are confident they ſhall be Saved; and ſo they would, if that Belief of theirs were but ſo effectual and operative as to produce ſuch a change in Heart and Life, as would denominate them New Creatures. But the miſchief is, they deceive themſelves in the nature of their Faith; it being but an Opinionative, Inoperative and dead Aſſent to the Truth of the Goſpel, ſuch as is only an Act of the Mind or Underſtanding, and doth not powerfully influence the Will, and ſo it is not <hi>a believing with all the Heart,</hi> but is the act only of one ſuch faculty of the Soul. A Belief it's probable may be found in the Devil himſelf: And ſuch a Belief was found in ſome who were ſo convinced by the power of Chriſt's Miracles, in concurrence with his Doctrine and Life, that they could not chooſe but believe him to be an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Perſon ſent from God; though their carnal Intereſt prevailed ſo much in them, as that it would not ſuffer them <hi>to confeſs him openly, becauſe they loved the praiſe of Men, more than the praiſe of God,</hi> Joh. 12.42, 43. And beſides, theſe Men deceive themſelves about their Faith in this alſo; that they do not heartily Believe the whole Doctrine of the Goſpel, but are partial in their Faith. They in a ſort believe Chriſt to be the Son of God, and that he came into the World to ſave ſinners, and that he Died for our ſins, and the like. But then they do not heartily believe his Doctrine, touching the neceſſity of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, of being born again; of <hi>denying all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and of living righteouſly, godly, and ſoberly in this preſent world.</hi> Or elſe they frame ſuch Notions of theſe things unto themſelves, of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Regeneration, as that they think they believe Chriſt's Doctrine touching them, when they believe only the lying Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their own Brains.</p>
                     <p>And there is too much ground to fear, that many Mens ill managing the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith, hath not a little ſtrengthened Men in this vain confidence. For while Evangelical Obedience it ſelf, under the Notion of thoſe Works to which Faith is oppoſed, hath been decryed as Popiſh, when intereſſed in Juſtification, and Juſtification aſſerted to be by Faith alone, in oppoſition to all Works whatſoever, Inward and Outward, as well Evangelical as Legal, as well thoſe after Converſion, as thoſe before, yea, and the diſpoſition thereunto; the Fleſh and the Devil to help it, hath got great advantage thereby to perſwade Men againſt the neceſſity of a holy Life, in ſuch a ſenſe of a holy Life, as the Scripture makes abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation. For though it's true that good Works have been acknowledged and preſſed too as neceſſary to Salvation; yet when withal, they have been denied to be neceſſary to Juſtification, and Men have been taught, that when once they are Juſtified, they can never fall away from a State of Juſtification, they have eaſily been drawn to believe, that good Works are not abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, no more than to Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but Faith only. And upon ſuppoſition that the other two Points of Doctrine are true, it would be but rational for them ſo to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:151517:37" rendition="simple:additions"/> believe. For if good Works be not neceſſary to Juſtification at all: And if it is impoſſible but that thoſe who are once juſtified ſhould be ſaved; how ſhould Men chuſe but infer from hence, that good Works are not abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation? Unleſs it ſhall be ſaid, that Men are not put into an immediate capacity of Salvation by being juſtified: Which to affirm, would be to ſay Men are not freed from Condemnation, by being freed from Condemnation, which would be a contradiction in terms: For to be juſtified, is to be freed from Condemnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34, and 5.16, 18. and therefore Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication muſt needs put Men into an immediate capacity of being ſaved.</p>
                     <p>And as there is great reaſon to think that the Doctrine of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Faith alone, in oppoſition to the Works of Evangelical Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, hath been a ſtumbling-ſtone unto many, and a back-friend to the power of Godlineſs; ſo there is another which hath been wont to be joyned with it, that hath rendred it the more dangerous, and it ſelf no good friend to holy Living; and that is the Doctrine of the Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs unto Juſtification, in that way in which it hath been managed by very many: For otherwiſe, there is a ſenſe (as I have ſhewed) in which it is a great and a comfortable Truth. For when Men have been taught to eſteem their own <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs but as filthy rags</hi> (not only becauſe of its utter inſufficiency to juſtifie inſtead of Chriſt, or as he juſtifies, in which reſpect indeed it is no better; but alſo as any part of a Condition of Juſtification, or of our acceptance with God:) And when they have been taught alſo, that upon their Believing only, Chriſt's Righteouſneſs in fulfilling the Law for them, becomes imputed to them in it ſelf, and not only as the procuring cauſe of their Juſtification upon the terms of the Goſpel, ſo that they are looked upon as having themſelves perfectly kept the Law in him, it hath doubtleſs infeebled their endeavours after an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Righteouſneſs, and proved a temptation to them, to think that ſo long as they have ſuch anothers Inherent Righteouſneſs eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially in it ſelf imputed to them as Chriſt's is, they have no great need to find it in themſelves; conſidering alſo, that if they had it, they muſt rather loath themſelves for it, than take any comfort in it: <hi>But let no man deceive you,</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>John) he that doth righteouſneſs, is righteous, as he is righteous,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.7.</p>
                     <p>I do acknowledge, that many of them have been worthy Men, who yet have propagated theſe Opinions: But that makes the Opinions never the better, but have done more hurt, in gaining thereby the more credit. It is true alſo, that thoſe worthy Men have zealouſly preſſed the neceſſity of Repentance, Regeneration, and a Holy Life: Which proved indeed an Antidote againſt the Poyſon of the other Opinions, ſo that they did not become Mortal to many, as otherwiſe they would have done. And indeed, they would have made mad work, if they had not been yoaked with wholeſomer Doctrine, as we ſee they did among <hi>Antinomians, Ranters,</hi> and other carnal Chriſtians that have followed the Ducture of thoſe Opinions, but have been ſhy of letting the Doctrines of Mortification and ſtrict Living, to have
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:151517:38"/> any power over them. But then if the preaching of thoſe ſounder Doctrines of Repentance, Regeneration, and a holy Life, have done much good, notwithſtanding they have been clogged with Opinions of another tendency; it is eaſie to imagine that they would have done much more good, if they had not been checkt by thoſe unſound Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
                     <p>But I ſhall ſay no more of this, (though more might be ſaid) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I hope I may ſay, that moſt of thoſe who have formerly imbibed theſe Opinions, are now come to deliver themſelves with more caution than heretofore. And ſo I ſhall proceed to the laſt thing I propounded to touch upon, and that is, to ſhew,</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> That the Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and of <hi>St.</hi> James, about Faith and Works, in reference to Juſtification, do not differ, but are wholly one.</head>
                     <p>IT is true indeed, though the Doctrine of St. <hi>PA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L,</hi> and St. <hi>JAMES,</hi> was in nothing oppoſite the one to the other, yet the nature of the ſubject-matter of their Epiſtles, did differ, juſt as the Errors they engaged againſt, did differ. The Errors of the unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jews</hi> conſiſting much in denying Juſtification to be by Chriſt, and Faith in him, and in placing it in their own Works of Circumciſing, Sacrificing, and other <hi>Moſaical</hi> Obſervations. And St. <hi>Paul,</hi> deſigning in ſome of his Epiſtles, to antidote the Chriſtians againſt the Infection of them, and to eſtabliſh them in the ſaving Doctrine of the Goſpel, was led of courſe to bend his Diſcourſe in great part againſt Juſtification by Works of the Law; and on the contrary, to aſſert it to be by Faith in Chriſt, in his Death, and in his Doctrine, without thoſe Works. Whereas St. <hi>James</hi> having to do in his Epiſtle, with ſuch as profeſſed the Chriſtian Faith and Juſtification by it, but erring dangerouſly about the nature of Faith, as juſtifying, thinking that opinionative Faith would ſave them, though deſtitute of a real change in the moral frame and conſtitution of their Souls, and of a holy Life: Hereupon it became in a manner as neceſſary for him to plead the Renovation of Man's Nature, and Evangelical Obedience to be ſome way neceſſary unto Juſtification, as it was for St. <hi>Paul</hi> to contend for Juſtification by Faith, without the deeds of the Law. And therefore, though their Doctrines in this reſpect did in great part differ, yet they did not differ as Truth differs from Error, nor as oppoſites, but only as one Truth differs from another. For otherwiſe, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> had to do with the like Erroneous and Scandalous Chriſtians, as thoſe were which St. <hi>James</hi> expoſtulated the matter with: When he had to do with ſuch
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:151517:38"/> as had a form of Godlineſs, but denyed the power thereof, he could, and did decry a reprobate Faith, and plead the neceſſity of a <hi>Faith</hi> that is <hi>unfeighned,</hi> and of a holy Life, as well as St. <hi>James;</hi> as appears in part by what was ſaid in the former Chapter, and will, I doubt not, be made ſufficiently evident in this. In order whereto, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to conſideration theſe ten things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That Works of Evangelical Obedience, are never in Scripture oppoſed to God's Grace.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in ſpeaking againſt Juſtification by Works, gives ſufficient Caution not to be underſtood thereby to ſpeak any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Evangelical Obedience in reference thereto.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That Regeneration, or the New Creature, as including Evangelical Obedience, is oppoſed to Works in the buſineſs of Man's Juſtification, as well as Faith is, and as well as the Grace of God it ſelf is.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That Evangelical Obedience, as well as Faith, and together with Faith, is oppoſed to the Works of the Law, in reference to Juſtification.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That Evangelical Obedience alone, is oppoſed to the Works of the Law.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Faith it ſelf is an Act of Evangelical Obedience.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. By Evangelical Obedience, Chriſtians come to have a Right to Salvation.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Promiſe of benefit by the Blood of Chriſt, is made to Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Obedience.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Repentance. And 10. Forgiving Injuries, are both Acts of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Obedience, without which a Man cannot be juſtifyed. And if theſe things be made out, they will (I think) amount to ſuch a demonſtration, as that we cannot well deſire a clearer or fuller proof, that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> together with others the Apoſtles, taught Juſtification by Evangelical Obedience, as the effect of Faith, as well as St. <hi>James.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Works of Evangelical Obedience, as the effects of Faith, and Regeneration by Faith, are never in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, or any other the holy Scriptures, oppoſed to God's Grace, in reference to Juſtification and Salvation. Works and Grace indeed are oppoſed to each other: But then, by Works we are to underſtand either Works antecedent to Converſion, or as they are denied to merit at the hands of God: Or the Works of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as Erroneouſly contended for by the <hi>Jews:</hi> Or the Works of the Law, as Typical, and as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to things Typify'd: Or the Works of the Law, as the Law is in its rigour oppoſed to the milder Oeconomy of the Goſpel: But the Works of Evangelical Obedience are never oppoſed to Grace, no more than Faith it ſelf is. And there is no reaſon why they ſhould, becauſe Evangelical Obedience is the effect of Divine Grace, as well as Faith it ſelf is, and tends to the praiſe of it, and is accepted, and will be rewarded through Grace.</p>
                     <p>Contrary hereunto, thoſe words in <hi>Titus</hi> 3.5. <hi>Not by works of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us,</hi> are wont to be alledged to prove that Works, after Converſion, as well as thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are oppoſed to the Mercy of God in the ſaving of Men. But whether this be duly collected from theſe words, will beſt appear
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:151517:39"/> by opening the ſcope and meaning of the words with the Context. The words in the 3, 4, and 5, Verſes, are theſe; <hi>For we our ſelves alſo were ſometimes fooliſh, ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. But after that the kindneſs and love of God our Saviour towards Man appeared: Not by Works of Righteouſneſs, which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us by the waſhing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> By their being Saved here, is meant their being reſcued and delivered from their ſinful ſtate, mentioned <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. In that this is ſaid to be done, not by Works of Righteouſneſs which they had done, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God's Mercy: The plain meaning (I doubt not) is, that this change of their condition, and deliverance from their ſinful ſtate, was not effected, or ſo much as begun among them by any Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own, till the Goſpel came to work it, (which is meant by the appearing of the Kindneſs and Love of God, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. and is of like import with that Chap. 2.11, 12.) which God of his Mercy, and not of their Deſert, ſent among them to that end. And if this be the meaning of the words, the Apoſtle was far from intending by Works of Righteouſneſs in this place, Works after Converſion. I might rather well argue on the contrary from this place: That Baptiſm, which is an act of Evangelical Obedience in the Perſon Baptized; and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, which is Evangelical Obedience in the Root and Principle, are, together with the Mercy of God, and, as ſubordinate to it, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Works of Righteouſneſs here mentioned, in the Work of Salvation. For it is probable, that by the waſhing of Regeneration here, is meant Baptiſm, as the Figure of Regeneration; and by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the Holy Ghoſt, Regeneration it ſelf. By both which, as ſubordinate to God's Mercy therein, they were ſaid to be ſaved, and not by the Works of Righteouſneſs, which they had done before theſe. There is another place in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9. which is wont to be urged with this to <hi>Titus,</hi> to the ſame purpoſe: But it being of the ſame nature with this, the ſame Anſwer may ſerve both with a little variation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in ſpeaking againſt Juſtification by Works, gives ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient caution not to be underſtood thereby to ſpeak againſt Evangelical Obedience in the caſe. When he had aſſerted Juſtification to be by Faith, without the deeds of the Law, and that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> might be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Believing, without ever obſerving <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. leſt he ſhould be underſtood thereby to favour <hi>Gentiliſm,</hi> or looſe living in Men, provided they would but turn Chriſtians; he frames and anſwers on Objection thus <hi>verſ.</hi> 31. <hi>Do we make void the Law through Faith? God forbid: Yea, we eſtabliſh the Law.</hi> And how did they ſo? Certainly they did not thereby eſtabliſh the Ceremonial Law in the Letter of it, but in the Spirit of it they did, in as much as in Preaching Juſtification in the Goſpel-way, they Preached in plain Precepts the neceſſity of that Spiritual purity unto Salvation, which was but darkly, and in a figure taught by the Ceremonial Law: And this they did, in Preaching the neceſſity of Mortification inſtead of Circumciſion. And by the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith, they

So that all that he deſigned in taking them off from their Law, was but to put them under a better conduct: To make them <hi>dead to the Law, that they might be married to another,</hi> viz. to Chriſt by his Goſpel, that <hi>they might bring forth fruit unto God,</hi> as it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. And likewiſe in <hi>ver.</hi> 6. he ſaith, <hi>We are delivered from the Law,</hi> but not to be Lawleſs, but <hi>that we might ſerve in newneſs of Spirit, and not in the oldneſs of the Letter;</hi> that is, according to the Spirit, Scope, and Deſign of the Law, now expreſſed in plain Precepts, and not in the oldneſs of the Letter and Ceremony. And ſo he ſaith of himſelf, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.19. <hi>I through the Law am dead to the Law, i, e,</hi> he through a better underſtanding of God's deſign in the Law, became dead as to all his former expectations of Juſtification by it. But then, if he were dead to the Law, it was, as he ſaith, that he might <hi>live unto God,</hi> live <hi>a life in the fleſh through the Faith in his Son,</hi> through believing his Goſpel in its Precepts and Promiſes; the one directing, and the other quickning unto a moſt excellent Life, <hi>ver.</hi> 20.</p>
                     <p>And if St. <hi>Paul</hi> were thus careful in denying Juſtification by Works, to aſſert the neceſſity of Evangelical Obedience, we may well conclude that he never intended, under the notion of Works of the Law, to exclude Evangelical Obedience from having any hand ſooner or later in Juſtification.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Regeneration, or the New Creature, as including Evangelical Obedience, is oppoſed to Works of the Law, in the buſineſs of Man's Juſtification, as well as Faith is, and as well as the Grace of God it ſelf is. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15. <hi>For in Chriſt Jeſus, neither Circumciſion availeth any thing, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion, but a new Creature.</hi> Circumciſion is here as elſewhere by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> put for the Works of the Law in general. For there were none that were for Circumciſing, but who were alſo for keeping the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> Only Circumciſion is mentioned fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently inſtead of all the reſt, becauſe they held it to be not only a part of the Law, but more; and becauſe they laid the greateſt ſtreſs upon it, as I ſhewed before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. Now in that which the Apoſtle denies Circumciſion and the Works of the Law to avail a Man, in that he affirms the becoming a New Creature will avail him, and that was in the buſineſs of Juſtification and Salvation: For in that ſenſe the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Judaizers</hi> held Circumciſion and other Works of the Law available. And this New Creature thus oppoſed to Works,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:151517:40"/> and thus available to Juſtification, conſiſteth in a new frame of Spirit, and the Vital Operations thereof, and which we can have no right notion of, without Evangelical Obedience in will and reſolution at leaſt (which are really inward acts of that Obedience, and are a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of the renewed Will to the Divine Law).</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Evangelical Obedience, as well as Faith, and together with Faith, is oppoſed to the Works of the Law in reference to Juſtification and Salvation. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. <hi>For in Chriſt Jeſus, neither Circumciſion availeth any thing, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion, but Faith which worketh by love.</hi> Here again Circumciſion, by the ſame Figure, and for the ſame reaſon as before, is put for the Works of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law. And as theſe are denied to avail any Man to Juſtification and Salvation, ſo on the other hand it is affirmed, that that Faith which worketh by Love doth avail to theſe great ends. For to ſay that Faith which worketh by Love doth ſo, is the ſame in ſenſe, as to ſay, that Faith which worketh by fulfilling the Law, and by keeping the Commandments, doth ſo avail: For ſo Love is ſaid to be, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.10. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.3. The Aſſemblies <hi>Annotations</hi> upon the place give notice, that the Word here tranſlated <hi>[Worketh]</hi> (Faith which worketh by Love) being in the mean, or middle voice, may be taken either Actively or Paſſively. And ſeveral other Learned Men (among whom Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> is one) do render and underſtand it paſſively; as if the Apoſtle ſhould have ſaid, Faith which is <hi>wrought,</hi> or <hi>perfected,</hi> or <hi>conſummate</hi> by Love, and ſo make it directly parallel with that in St. <hi>James,</hi> Chap. 2.22. <hi>By Works was Faith made perfect.</hi> So far is the Scripture we ſee from oppoſing acts of Evangelical Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Faith in the Works of Juſtification, as that it conjoyns them with Faith in the title to it, and in oppoſition to falſe pretentions to it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Evangelical Obedience alone is oppoſed to the Works of the Law in reference to Juſtification; ſo far is it from being true, that where the Works of the Law are excluded, there Evangelical Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is excluded from having any ſhare in the Work of Juſtification. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.19. <hi>Circumciſion is nothing, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion is nothing, but the keeping of the Commandments of God.</hi> Circumciſion is here again, as before, put for the whole Law: And indeed, he that was Circumciſed, was bound to keep the whole Law, as this Apoſtle noteth in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. And when he ſaith Circumciſion is nothing, he means here doubtleſs, as in thoſe other places already opened, that it avails nothieg to any Mans acceptation with God, or to his Juſtification and Salvation, as the <hi>Judaizers</hi> of thoſe Times thought it did. But then the keeping of the Commandments of God will avail to theſe ends: For that I conceive was intended, and ought to be underſtood by the oppoſition that is made between Circumciſion and keeping the Commandments.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Faith it ſelf is an act of Evangelical Obedience; this as well as Love is an act of Conformity to our Lord's Commands; and therefore a Man cannot be juſtified by Faith, but in being ſo, he muſt be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Evangelical Obedience. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23. <hi>This is his Commandments, that we ſhould believe in the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and love one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as he gave us Commandment.</hi> This by our Saviour is called a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:151517:40" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                        <hi>work,</hi> Joh. 6.29. <hi>This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath ſent.</hi> And there is ſo much of the nature of Evangelical Obedience in Faith it ſelf, as that to Believe and to Obey are promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly put one for another; and ſo is Unbelief and Diſobedience. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly you have in many places the one reading in the Text, and the other in the Margin, as <hi>Acts</hi> 5.36. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.30, 31. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.11. and 11.31. And Belief and Diſobedience are in Scripture oppoſed to each other as direct contraries, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.12.</p>
                     <p>So that ſince Faith is an act of Evangelical Obedience, it follows that to ſay the Works of Evangelical Obedience do juſtifie, does no more derogate from the Grace of God, or the freeneſs of his Grace in juſtiying, than to ſay Faith juſtifies. Firſt, Becauſe other acts of Evangelical Obedience are the effects of God's Grace, and produced by it, as well as Faith. <hi>It is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleaſure,</hi> Phil. 2.13. And ſecondly, Becauſe it is meerly of the Law of Grace, that Faith and other Acts of Evangelical Obedience, are made the condition of the Promiſe of Salvation. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>By grace are ye ſaved, through Faith in Chriſt Jeſus; and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God.</hi> As Men do not Believe or Obey of themſelves without ſupernatural Aſſiſtance, ſo neither is it of themſelves that they are Juſtified or Saved upon their Believing, but both the one and the other, is the Gift of God. <hi>It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy.</hi> It is by virtue of God's New Covenant, that a promiſe of Pardon is made to Repentance, or to Faith; for the primary Law, the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, promiſed no ſuch thing upon Repentance. And it is by virtue of the ſame Law of Grace, that a Promiſe of Juſtification and Reward is made to ſincere Obedience in other Acts of Obedience, as well as thoſe of Faith and Repentance.</p>
                     <p>That which hath made many afraid of intereſſing Evangelical Obedience with Faith, in juſtifying Men, hath been an Opinion, that ſo to do would derogate from God's Grace, and attribute too much to Man. But you ſee there is no ground for ſuch an Opinion. It's true indeed, the proper merit of Works, and God's Grace are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent: And therefore are oppoſed to each other in Scripture. But Evangelical Obedience, and Grace, are no more oppoſite or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, than Cauſe and Effect, or than Cauſes principal and ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. And as it doth not follow, that becauſe we are juſtified freely by God's Grace, that therefore we are not juſtified by Faith: So neither doth it follow, that becauſe we are juſtified by Faith, that therefore we are not juſtified by ſincere Obedience. For theſe and the Blood of Chriſt, do all concur in producing many of the ſame Effects, though not in the ſame reſpect.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. By Evangelical Obedience, Chriſtians come to have a right to Salvation. <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his Commandments, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But ſeeing that a Right to <hi>Salvation</hi> doth accrue to Men upon a ſincere keeping of God's Commandments, notwithſtanding their forfeiture of their firſt Right by Man's firſt Fall, it evidently follows, that Evangelical or Sincere Obedience, is part of the condition of the Promiſe of Bleſſedneſs in the New Law or Covenant, and is here put for the whole of it, as at other times Faith is put for the whole of the Condition. And that <hi>Moſes, David, Solomon, Nehemiah,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> received it in this ſenſe, and underſtood all along that ſincere Obedience flowing from Love, was the condition of God's Covenant of Mercy when they ſtiled him a God keeping Covenant and Mercy with thoſe that Love him, and keep his Commandments, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.9. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.23. <hi>Neh.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.4. I have before ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>If it ſhall be here ſaid, that ſincere Obedience is indeed a condition of Salvation, but not of Juſtification, and that it is ſo made here in this 22d of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> I have I think ſufficiently anſwered this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in the former Chapter; but ſhall here add, That ſuch as thus ſay, are more curious and nice in diſtinguiſhing between Juſtification and Salvation, than St. <hi>Paul</hi> was. For he calls Juſtification, <hi>the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Life,</hi> Rom. 5.18. <hi>Whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified,</hi> Rom. 8.30. and proves that Men ſhall be juſtified by Faith, becauſe it is written that <hi>the Juſt ſhall live by Faith,</hi> Gal. 3.11. Thus with him to be juſtified, and to be bleſſed are all one, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8, 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.7, 8, 9. And to confirm this Righteouſneſs or Juſtification and Life, are uſed by him as Synonimous terms, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. <hi>For if there had been a Law given which could have given life, verily Righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the Law.</hi> And Juſtification and Condemnation are but in direct oppoſition to each other, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. and 8.33, 34. And to be freed from Condemnation (which is Juſtification) and to be Saved, are as much one, as not to Dye, is to Live. In ſhort, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation as well as Juſtification, is promiſed to Believing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.31. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.39. And therefore Salvation, as well as Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, muſt needs be the immediate effect of Faith; if we take Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as begun here in this Life (as the Scripture repreſents it to be,<hi>Joh.</hi> 5.24. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14. and 5.12.) From all which we may conclude, That what is abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, muſt needs alſo be neceſſary to Juſtification.</p>
                     <p>Add we hereto, that to be juſtified, and to be ſaved, is the ſame thing with St. <hi>James,</hi> as well as it is with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> according to the tenour of his Reaſoning, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. from ver. 14. to the end. <hi>What doth it profit my brethren</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>though a man ſay he hath Faith, and have not Works? Can Faith ſave him?</hi> Verſ. 14. This Interrogation implies an Emphatical Negation; and the meaning is, that ſuch a Faith can by no means ſave a Man; and he gives the reaſon of it twice

And then afterwards argues the neceſſity of Works, together with Faith, unto Juſtification, or unto Salvation (which was the thing he began with) by God's juſtifying <hi>Abraham</hi> by Works, together with his Faith, who was the great Pattern or Example of God's juſtifying all others. If then to be juſtified, and to be ſaved, amounts to the ſame in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe here, then by the way, they do not rightly underſtand St. <hi>James,</hi> who think he doth not ſpeak of a Juſtification before God in this his Diſcourſe about Juſtification by Works, together with Faith, but of a Juſtification before Men, and to their own Conſcience only. Which ſuppoſition of theirs, doth directly thwart the very ſcope and deſign of his whole Diſcourſe, which is to ſet forth what will, and what will not avail a Chriſtian-Profeſſor in the ſight of God, to the ſaving of his Soul, as abundantly appears. So that <hi>the Scripture which ſaith A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham believed God, and it was accounted to him for Righteouſneſs;</hi> and which St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith <hi>was fulfilled</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s being juſtified by Works as well as by Faith, was not fulfilled in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s being juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to others, and to his own Conſcience, but in his being juſtified before God; and ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> underſtood it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.6. But this was touched before in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p>The reſult then of what hath been argued in Anſwer to the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That all that are juſtified, are thereby put regularly into an immediate capacity of Salvation; ſo that if they ſhould dye the very next moment after they are once juſtified, they would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be ſaved. And therefore Evangelical Obedience can be no more neceſſary to Salvation, than it is to Juſtification; and it is as neceſſary to the one as to the other. And if to ſay Evangelical Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is neceſſary to Juſtification, be injurious to Chriſt, and to the Grace of God, as ſome would pretend, how comes it to paſs then, that to ſay Evangelical Obedience is neceſſary to Salvation, is not ſo too? For our final Salvation is as much the effect of God's Grace, and of Chriſt's Undertaking for us, as our Juſtification it ſelf is, and of as much Value. And therefore if the one be not injurious in this kind, neither is the other.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. As the Promiſe of forgiveneſs of ſins by the Blood of Chriſt, or the Promiſe of an intereſt in his Blood to the pardon of Sin, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times made unto Believing; ſo ſometimes again it is made unto Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Obedience, or a holy Life, as in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>If we walk in the light, as he is in the light,</hi> (that is, endeavouring to be holy, as God is holy) <hi>then have we fellowſhip one with another, and the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all Sin;</hi> but otherwiſe, it doth not. And ſo the Chriſtians to whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> wrote, were ſaid to be <hi>elect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fore-knowledge of God the Father, through Sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience, and ſprinkling of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. But they were not elect to the benefit of being ſprinkled with the Blood of Chriſt without Obedience. And therefore by this
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:151517:44"/> we ſee alſo, that Evangelical Obedience is part of the Condition of the Promiſe of Juſtification by the Blood of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. To forgive Injuries is an act of Evangelical Obedience to that Precept of our Lord, <hi>Mar.</hi> 11.25. And yet without this act of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, Men that have been injured, cannot be juſtified, becauſe they cannot be pardoned, according to the Word of our Lord, <hi>Mark</hi> 11.26. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.15. and 18.35. Therefore Evangelical Obedience muſt needs be part of the Condition of Juſtification.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Repentance is an eminent Act of Evangelical Obedience, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. and yet pardon of ſin, which is eſſential to Juſtification, is not to be obtained without it, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.3, 5. Therefore again it follows, that Evangelical Obedience is neceſſary to Juſtification, and part of the Condition of it.</p>
                     <p>And now by this time I ſuppoſe it fully appears to any unprejudiced Reader, that the Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> yea, and of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> too, do fully accord with the Doctrine of St. <hi>James,</hi> touching the neceſſity of Evangelical Obedience unto Juſtification. The oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition then which ſome have made between Faith and all Internal and External Works in reference to Juſtification, as well Evangelical, as <hi>Moſaical,</hi> hath not been only <hi>without</hi> Scripture-ground, but <hi>againſt</hi> Scripture-evidence; and looks more like that which was made by the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> or other <hi>Soliſidians,</hi> oppoſed by St. <hi>James,</hi> (if it be not the very ſame) than any the Scripture any where maketh. And how much injury the Chriſtian Religion and the Souls of Men may have ſuffered thereby, is a thing to be thought on, and ſadly laid to Heart.</p>
                     <p>It is a pleaſant Doctrine, and the worſt of Men called Chriſtians are glad to hear that they may be juſtify'd by Chriſt, only upon their Believing in him, without any Works of Righteouſneſs or Self-denial of their own. And upon that account (preſuming verily that they do Believe) they are confident that they are juſtify'd, though they are unſanctify'd. But thoſe eſpecially are in great danger of deceiving their own Souls, by building their Confidence upon this Doctrine, who, together with this Belief, have more of the form of Godlineſs than the other have, and are found much more in the uſe and exerciſe of the external Devotional part of Religion, and are zealous for this or that Opinion, Party, or Way, which they think moſt Orthodox; though they be greatly deſtitute of Love to the Nature of God, and of Humility, Charity, ſtrict Juſtice, Fidelity, Peaceableneſs, Sobriety, Temperance, Modeſty, and Meekneſs, and of that renewed frame of Soul which would make them like Chriſt Jeſus, wherein the power of Chriſtianity doth conſiſt: The external Duties of Hearing, Reading, Praying, and the reſt, being in great part but means referring to the other as the end. So that no Man is to account himſelf truly Religious,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:151517:44"/> further than he attains to theſe truly Chriſtian Qualifications, by the uſe of the External M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And therefore there is great need for thoſe that are Spiritual Guides to the People, to inſiſt much upon the neceſſity of Repentance, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and a holy Life, as well as Faith, in order to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtified and ſaved by Chriſt Jeſus. For the People, yea, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort of them, ſtand moſt in need, as of being well-grounded touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion, ſo eſpecially of having the Doctrines of Morality inculcated upon them, the Precepts of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel being almoſt all of that Nature, (thought ſome ſpeak diminutively of moral Preaching) and tend to the perfecting of the Nature of Man, in regulating the Internal Operations of the Soul, and the External Actions of Life, in reference both to God and Man, our Selves and Others: The recovering of Men to which, is God's great Deſign by the Goſpel, in order to their being made perfectly Happy at laſt, as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chap. 1.</p>
                     <p>There is indeed an abſolute neceſſity of Believing the Goſpel in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Chriſtian Practice: And therefore our bleſſed Saviour did not only Preach the neceſſity of Faith in him and his Doctrine, but alſo wrought abundance of Miracles to beget this Faith in Men. And yet he knowing the great danger of Men's miſcarrying in point of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality in the diſpoſition of Soul and actions of Life, inſiſted chiefly in his Preaching, upon Doctrines of that nature; as you may ſee in his Sermon on the Mount, and elſewhere. He taught the neceſſity of being <hi>born again: Of making the Tree good, that the Fruit might be good.</hi> And to inforce this Doctrine of his, he was not wont to tell his Auditors that every Man ſhall be Rewarded according to his Belief, but that <hi>when the Son of Man ſhall come, every Man ſhall be rewarded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Works:</hi> That <hi>thoſe that have done good, ſhall come forth to the reſurrection of life; and thoſe that have done evil, to the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of damnation:</hi> That <hi>by their words they ſhall be juſtified</hi> (which are no more Faith than Works are) and <hi>by Their words they ſhall be condemned:</hi> That in the Great Day of the Tryal of all Nations, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man ſhall be Acquitted or Condemned, according to the Good they have done, or neglected to do, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25 And that then not every Man that had Faith enough to <hi>Cry, Lord, Lord,</hi> or, <hi>to Propheſie, cast out Devils, or do wonders in his Name, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> but ſuch and ſuch only <hi>as have done the will of his Father.</hi>

                  <head>A DISCOURSE ON FAITH.</head>
                  <p>MEN's Eternal Eſtate of Weal or Wo in another World, and their Peace and Comfort in this, being very much concerned in their right underſtanding, or miſtaking the nature and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of that Faith which is Saving, and of that which is not; I ſhall here ſtate the nature and difference of thoſe two kinds of Faith, with what brevity and perſpicuity I can. I cannot (I confeſs) think that the nature of Faith, which is of abſolute neceſſity to the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the meaneſt Chriſtian, is in it ſelf hard to be underſtood, were it not that the many Controverſies about it, about its Object, and the Acts of the Soul neceſſary to it, had puzzled Mens Minds, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted their Apprehenſions concerning it.</p>
                  <p>Things abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, as they are not many, ſo there are hardly any Doctrines delivered with more plainneſs than they, that the Weak who are as much concerned in them as the Strong, might competently underſtand them as well as they.</p>
                  <p>Men may multiply Notions about Faith, as the Scripture uſeth va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious expreſſions about it: But I doubt not but that the general ſenſe of the Scripture hereabout may be ſummarily expreſſed in this plain Propoſition: That ſaving Faith is ſuch a Belief of Chriſt to be the Son of God, and of the truth of his Doctrine, eſpecially touching the virtue of his Death and Reſurrection, and the neceſſity of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Life, for the obtaining Remiſſion of Sin, and Eternal Life, as cauſeth a Man to deny all Ungodlineſs and Worldly Luſts, and to Live a Godly, Righteous, and a Sober Life.</p>

                  <p>This is ſo plain in Scripture, as that there is no Chriſtian ſo weak but may eaſily come to underſtand it; and ſo evident, that none who acknowledge the Truth of the Goſpel, can deny it. That I may ſtate the difference then between Effectual and Ineffectual Faith, and matters relating to them, with all the plainneſs I can, I ſhall very briefly endeavour theſe five things.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. I. I.</hi> The Comprehenſive Nature of ſaving Faith opened.</head>
                     <p>THat I may open the comprehenſive Nature of Faith the better, I ſhall firſt obſerve, how variouſly the Condition, upon which ſaving Benefits are promiſed, is expreſſed in Scripture, and then what actings of the Soul are thereby ſignified.</p>
                     <p>It is thus variouſly expreſſed in Scripture: Sometimes it's called a believing God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.6. a believing in God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. a believing on God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.24. a believing the Record which God hath given of his Son, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10. Sometimes it's called a believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16, 36. <hi>Acts</hi> 16.31. a believing him to be the Chriſt the Son of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.31. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.5. It's called Faith in his Blood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. a believing that God raiſed him from the dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. Sometimes it's called a believing of the Goſpel, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15, 16. a believing of the Truth, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.15. a believing the teſtimony of the Apoſtles, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10. Sometimes it is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed under the Notion of Repentance, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. and 3.19. and 11.18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. and ſometimes of Obedience, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9.</p>
                     <p>The Condition of the Promiſe of ſaving Benefits being thus va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly expreſſed, can ſignifie no leſs than a three-fold Act of the Soul: The firſt, being the Act of the Underſtanding: The ſecond, of the Will: The third, of the Underſtanding and Will conjunct.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:151517:48"/>1. Such expreſſions of the Condition of the Promiſe as is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in God, the believing his Record, the believing the Goſpel the believing Chriſt to be the Son of God, do moſt properly ſignifie the Act of the Mind or Underſtanding, in <hi>Aſſenting</hi> to the truth of what God teſtifieth, or promiſeth. Which aſſent is grounded upon a knowledge, or belief of God's Veracity, his Truth, and Faithfulneſs, armed with All-ſufficiency of Power, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs, to make good his Word to a tittle. And although ſuch expreſſions as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, do moſt properly ſignifie the act of the Underſtanding, yet whenever ſaving Benefits are promiſed, and the Condition expreſſed in ſuch a form of Words as doth moſt properly and primarily ſignifie the <hi>Aſſent</hi> of the Mind, even then the act of the Will in <hi>Conſenting</hi> to the Condition, is implyed, and ought to be underſtood; as I ſhall fully prove in the next Particular.</p>
                     <p>And the reaſon why the whole of the Promiſe relating to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Will, as well as the Aſſent of the Underſtanding, is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently expreſſed in ſuch a form of words, as primarily and ſtrictly ſignifie the Aſſent of the Mind, is, I conceive, becauſe ſuch <hi>Aſſent</hi> of the Mind, is the Principle from which all concurrent acts of the Will neceſſary to Juſtification and Salvation do proceed.</p>
                     <p>And it is of frequent uſe in Scripture, to denominate the whole of Religion, by ſome one Principal part, which is a fruitful Principle of all the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Knowledge of the true God, and of Jeſus Chriſt whom-he hath ſent, is ſaid to be Eternal Life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3. And thus ſome times the Fear of God, and ſometimes the Love of God, is put for the whole of Mens ſaving Religiouſneſs, and the ſame Promiſe of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs made to one of theſe ſingly expreſt, is to be extended to the whole.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, the whole of Chriſtianity, is frequently denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Faith,</hi> and the Chriſtians ſtiled <hi>Believers,</hi> and the <hi>Houſhold of Faith,</hi> and the like; and all becauſe that Chriſtian Life of theirs, by which they differ from other Men, flows from their Faith, which is the firſt active Principle of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another act of the Soul eſſentially neceſſary to that Faith which is the Condition of the Promiſe, is the <hi>Conſent</hi> of the Will to Repent, to receive Chriſt as Lord and King, to be governed by his Laws as well as to own him for a Prieſt once Offering himſelf, and ever making Interceſſion for us.</p>
                     <p>For the Condition of the Promiſe of Pardon and Salvation, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed under the notion of <hi>Repentance,</hi> and ſometimes of <hi>Obedience,</hi> as I ſhewed before: And Repentance and Obedience are acts of the Will as renewed.</p>
                     <p>And that there is no Promiſe of ſaving Benefits upon meer Believing, without obſerving that part of the Condition which conſiſteth in Repentance, Regeneration, and Obedience, is moſt evident: Becauſe they are expreſly excluded in Scripture from having any ſhare in the ſaving Benefits of the Covenant, Juſtification, or Salvation, who do not Repent, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.3. who are not Regenerate, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. who Love
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:151517:49"/> not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and that above any Worldly Enjoyment 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.37. and who do not Obey him, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22, 23. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7. By all which we may certainly know, that whenever there is Promiſe of Juſtification and Salvation made to Believing, it is to be underſtood of ſuch a Believing as doth at that inſtant in which a Man believes, ſavingly produce a ſincere Conſent of the Will to Repent, to Love Chriſt, and to Obey him: For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thoſe Scriptures, and theſe would be inconſiſtent.</p>
                     <p>For if Men cannot be Pardoned, nor delivered from the Curſe, nor be ſafe from Deſtruction, until they have Repented, are Regenerate, do love Chriſt, and Obey the Goſpel, as the forecited Scriptures do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us they cannot; then no Faith whatſoever is juſtifying, or can entitle them to Pardon and Salvation according to the Tenour of God's Promiſe, until it hath produced that Repentance, Regeneration, Love, and Obedience: Which is a full and an undeniable proof of the neceſſity of ſuch a conſent of the Will as aforeſaid, to render Faith juſtifying and ſaving.</p>
                     <p>Now this Conſent and reſolution of the Will to Repent and Obey Chriſt, and to forſake all for him, is the Moral Change of the Soul, and the New Life in its firſt beginning. And ſo a Man's firſt effectual Belief, is his whole Chriſtian Life in its beginning. And a Man's firſt Faith is perfected afterwards by Works, (<hi>Jam.</hi> 2.22.) as a Child is perfected in his manly ſtate, as he grows up to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly actions; or as the Seed is perfected when it grows to a full Ear.</p>
                     <p>By this firſt Conſent of the Will, we reſtipulate and ſtrike Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God; and not only ſo, but we hereby begin alſo to keep and perform Covenant with him on our part. When this Conſent is firſt wrought in the Will, then the Laws of the new Covenant are firſt put into the Mind and written in the Heart: And by this we firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to become ſavingly a People unto God, to Believe in him, to Love and Serve him, as he by Covenant and Promiſe becomes a God unto us, to make us Happy. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. <hi>This is the Covenant that I will make, I will put my Laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a People.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The other act of the Soul, which I call the act of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and of the VVill conjunct, is an <hi>Affiance</hi> in God through Chriſt; a truſting in him, or a relying on him for the fulfilling of his Promiſe of ſaving Benefits, while we continue ſincerely to Conſent, reſolve and endeavour to perform the Condition on our part.</p>
                     <p>This is that, or part of that, which is called a Believing <hi>on God,</hi> a Believing <hi>on Chriſt,</hi> and a <hi>Truſting in him:</hi> Noting the Souls depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon Chriſt for the ſaving Benefits which accrue to Men by his Mediation, Office, and Undertaking, and on the Truth and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, Power, VViſdom, and Goodneſs of God, to perform all that he hath promiſed them through his Son, and upon the terms he hath promiſed, and not otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>For the Promiſe of ſaving Benefits being made but upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition before-mentioned, a true Believer, or he that is Rational and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:151517:49"/> Wiſe, conſiders as well upon what terms the Benefits are promiſed, as who hath promiſed them, and what they are; and expects the one no otherwiſe than as he ſincerely reſolves and endeavours to perform the other.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, if any ſhall Rely on God and Chriſt for thoſe Benefits, in whom yet the qualifying Condition of the Promiſe of them is not found; ſuch a Reliance is but a groundleſs Preſumption, and not Faith or Affiance duly ſo called. For ſuch do not only rely on Chriſt for that for which they have no promiſe, but for that which God hath expreſly declared they ſhall have no ſhare in whilſt they remain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of that qualification, which is the Condition upon which, and not without it, the promiſe of thoſe Benefits is made.</p>
                     <p>Theſe three acts of the Soul exerciſed on their Objects, do make up that Faith which is juſtifying and ſaving. And when juſtifying Faith in the compleat nature of it is ſpoken of in Scripture, all theſe three acts of the Soul are to be underſtood, and eſpecially the two firſt; though perhaps they are many times mentioned ſeverally and apart; Faith being deſcribed ſometimes by one of them, and ſometimes by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: As God himſelf is repreſented to us, ſometimes by one At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, ſometimes by another.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Wherein the Defect lies of that Faith which is not ſaving.</head>
                     <p>BY what hath been diſcourſed touching the nature of that Faith which is ſaving, it is eaſie to diſcern wherein the defect lies of that Faith which is not ſo.</p>
                     <p>And the defect lies chiefly in the Will, in its not Conſenting to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Condition of the Promiſe, in Repenting, and in receiving Chriſt as Lord, to be governed by his Laws.</p>
                     <p>I will not deny but the defect in part may be in the Underſtanding, when its Aſſent unto the Truth of Divine Revelation is ſo weak, as that it can make but a too weak and faint impreſſion upon the Will, to procure its Conſent unto the Condition of the Promiſe.</p>
                     <p>But then that defect in the Aſſent of the Underſtanding, doth uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, at leaſt in great part, proceed from the Will; as I ſhall ſhew afterwards. Now, that the defect lies mainly in the Will's not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to the Condition of the Promiſe, appears by this; becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate Men may aſſent unto the truth of God's Teſtimony, and may truſt that they ſhall be ſaved by Chriſt, (which contain the other two acts of the Soul) but no Man truly conſents to perform the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:151517:50" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the Promiſe, but in doing ſo, he is Regenerate in the firſt Act, and Juſtified.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Unregenerate Men may have the ſame Faith of Aſſent in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to a degree, as the Regenerate may: They may believe God to be the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth, and Jeſus Chriſt to be his only Son, and the reſt of the Articles of the Creed; and they may believe in great part that to be their Duty both towards God, and Man, which is ſo indeed, and yet hold that Truth in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, which they do believe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Many of the chief Rulers believed on Chriſt,</hi> who yet <hi>loved the Praiſe of Men, more than the praiſe of God,</hi> and durſt <hi>not confeſs him,</hi> Joh. 12.42, 43. As alſo did many others when they ſaw his Maricles, who yet were ſuch as Chriſt had no mind to commit himſelf to, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.23, 24. And <hi>Simon Magus believed, wondering, and being aſtoniſhed at the ſigns which were done by Philip,</hi> who yet remained in the <hi>bond of iniquity,</hi> Acts 8. Such as are reſembled by the ſtony Ground, believed, who yet loved their eaſe, and worldly Intereſt more than Chriſt; and thoſe that St. <hi>James</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulates with, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. were thus far Believers alſo.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Excepting the Conſent of the Will to the Condition of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, Unregenerate Men may hope to be ſaved by Chriſt, and rely on him for Salvation as well as the Regenerate: Only for want of their performing the Condition of the Promiſe, their hopes and confidence are groundleſs, and will deceive them. But otherwiſe, Men that are but carnal, and live in ſome known ſin, may, and oftentimes do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves that they ſhall be ſaved by Chriſt Jeſus, becauſe they believe that he died for Sinners, and becauſe they ask God forgiveneſs, and perform ſome acts of Religion.</p>
                     <p>Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Many will ſay unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, open unto us: Have we not propheſied in thy Name, and in thy Name have caſt out Devils, and done many wonderful works? We have eaten and drunk in thy preſence, and thou haſt taught in our ſtreets.</hi> To whom he will ſay for all that, <hi>Depart from me, ye workers of iniquity,</hi> Matth. 7.22, 23. Luke 13.25, 26. Theſe had ſome kind of Faith in Chriſt, by which they Propheſied in his Name, and caſt out Devils, and did many wonderful Works. They were ſuch as were Hearers of his Word and Preachers of it too, and had eaten and drunk in his Preſence. And becauſe of this Faith, and theſe Works, they had a Hope and Confidence that Chriſt would open unto them, and receive them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Kingdom, and would not be eaſily beaten off from this Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                     <p>But the true reaſon why their Faith will ſtand them in no ſtead, nor their Religious performances neither, is, becauſe for all that, they were workers of Iniquity; they never heartily conſented to the Terms of the Promiſe of Salvation by Chriſt in Repenting: They did not firſt heartily reſolve, and after ſincerely endeavour to turn from every known Sin, unto every known Duty. And in this very thing doth the defect of that Faith lie which is ſhort of ſaving.</p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:151517:50"/>
                     <p>VVhich will yet farther appear, in that St. <hi>James,</hi> when he would ſtate the difference between that Faith which is ſaving, and that which is not, fixeth it here.</p>
                     <p>The dead Faith is denominated ſuch by him, from its being alone without VVorks, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Even ſo Faith, if it hath not Works, is dead, being alone, or by it ſelf.</hi> And again, <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>But wilt thou know, O vain Man, that Faith without Works is dead.</hi> And again, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. <hi>For as the body without the Spirit is dead,</hi> ſo <hi>Faith without Works is dead alſo.</hi> Meaning by its being dead, that it avails a Man no more to his Juſtification and Salvation, than a dead Corps avails to the producing the uſeful and ſerviceable effects of a Living Man; or than a Tree that is dead, avails to the bringing forth Fruit; or than a few good words, <hi>Depart in peace, be ye filled and warmed,</hi> will avail poor people, <hi>when nothing is given which is needful to the body,</hi> ver. 15, 16, 17.</p>
                     <p>In all this I do not deny, but that there may be in ſuch as do not ſavingly believe, ſome Conſent of the Will to do ſomething towards performing the Condition of the Promiſe, in Repenting and Obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Such Men may Conſent and reſolve to forſake ſome ſins, and to do ſome, yea many Duties, who yet never ſavingly conſent, becauſe they do not heartily conſent and reſolve to forſake [All] known ſin, and to do [All] known duties; in which the ſincerity of Repentance and Obedience doth conſiſt, to which the Promiſe is made. Such Men may not be far from the Kingdom of God, but yet muſt go farther, if ever they would have any good ground of hope to enter into it: But of this more afterwards.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Whence this defect doth proceed.</head>
                     <p>I Have ſhewed before, that there is the Faith of aſſent in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding unto the truth of God's Teſtimony, in ſome unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Men, as well as in the regenerate. And in whomſoever the Faith of <hi>Conſent</hi> in the Will to perform the Condition of the Promiſe is found, it always proceeds from the Faith of <hi>Aſſent</hi> in the Underſtanding. A Man always (in order of Nature at leaſt) believes that the promiſed Benefits ſhall be made good to him, in caſe he perform the Condition, before he Conſents to perform it; and doth conſent to perform the Condition in hope and confidence of obtaining the promiſed Benefits.</p>
                     <p>Now then the Queſtion is, whence is it, and what is the reaſon, that the Faith of Aſſent in the Underſtanding doth not always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſame Conſent in the Will in one, as well as another; and as it always doth, when it becomes effectual to Juſtification and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Why doth this Faith remain alone in ſome, when as it is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Works in others?</p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:151517:51"/>
                     <p>I ſhall offer what I conceive to be the reaſon of this; Firſt, in general, and than more particularly.</p>
                     <p>The difference ſometimes may proceed from the different meaſures and degrees of the evidence upon which the ſame Truth is believed. One Man may have a clearer diſcerning of the evidence than another, which cauſeth a ſtronger Aſſent in the diſcerning faculty, and that ſtronger Aſſent in the Underſtanding, may well cauſe a ſtronger, Conſent in the Will, and a firm and laſting reſolution. As on the contrary a weak and partial Conſent and reſolution in the Will to the Condition, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times proceeds from a weak Aſſent in the Mind, to the Truth of God's Teſtimony, or Promiſe, and that from the weakneſs of the faculty in the diſcerning the evidence of that Truth which is the object of Faith.</p>
                     <p>But the reaſon moſt commonly why the <hi>Aſſent</hi> in the Underſtanding unto the Truth of God's Teſtimony doth not work a <hi>Conſent</hi> in the Will to the Condition of the Promiſe, is to be taken, I conceive, from the oppoſition which the lower faculties of the Soul, the Will and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, aſſiſted and influenced by the ſenſual Appetites, make againſt the ſuperiour Faculty, the Mind, or Underſtanding; ſo that they do not hearken to its Notices, nor obey its Dictates. The Will, which is the Spring of Action, is a middle Faculty, between the Underſtanding and the ſenſitive Affections or Appetites, and is ſolicited by both.</p>
                     <p>As the Underſtanding calls upon it to obey its rational Dictates in chuſing the means which tend to the beſt end, both which the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding repreſents to it from the Word of God; ſo on the other hand, the ſenſitive Affections ſolicite it to be on their ſide, and to be active in making proviſion for the Fleſh, in chuſing ſuch things as tend to ſatisfie its Cravings and Luſts. And becauſe the Will hath uſually been pre-ingaged to the Fleſh, and had a ſhare in its Gratifications, it's not without much difficulty prevailed with to be conſenting to, and active in the <hi>crucifixion of thoſe Affections and Luſts.</hi> Which until the Will do, and herein obey the enlightned Underſtanding, the Faith of <hi>Aſſent</hi> in the Underſtanding abideth alone. The Will's obſtinate adherence then to Mens fleſhly Luſts, and carnal Intereſts, in oppoſition to that belief in the Underſtanding which puts it upon deſtroying them, as abſolutely neceſſary to the Man's Salvation, as believing God touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the neceſſity of this as a means, as well as it doth believe him touching the bleſſedneſs of the end; this obſtinate oppoſition in the Will, I ſay, is the true reaſon why the Faith which is in ſome Men, is but a dead Faith. <hi>How can ye believe</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>which ſeek honour one of another, and ſeek not the honour that cometh from God only?</hi> Joh. 5.44. Yes, ſome of them could, and did <hi>believe</hi> ſo far as to <hi>Aſſent</hi> in their Minds, that Chriſt was no Impoſtor, but one that came from God; and that therefore his Doctrine muſt needs be true; but they did not believe ſo as to be converted in their Wills, to conſent to part with their carnal intereſt of Honour and Reputation, with their Party the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> which they muſt have done as the caſe then ſtood, if they would have confeſſed him openly; which to do, was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to make them capable of the Promiſe of Salvation by him. <hi>Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The unbelief then of Men where the Goſpel comes, is generally to be reſolved into the obſtinacy of their Wills, in oppoſition to the convictions of their Underſtanding. <hi>John</hi> 5.40. <hi>Ye will not come to me that ye might have life. How oft would I have gathered you, and ye would not,</hi> Mat. 23.37. <hi>O that my people had hearkened to my counſel! But Iſrael would none of me,</hi> Pſal. 81.11. <hi>They did not chuſe the fear of the Lord,</hi> Prov. 1.29. <hi>They choſe</hi> their own ways, their Souls <hi>delighted in their abominations,</hi> Iſa. 6.3. Thus much in general. But I would ſhew yet more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly how the Will doth obſtruct the perfecting the work of Faith after it's begun in the Underſtanding. And it doth it as I conceive,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By calling off the Underſtanding from a frequent conſideration of that evidence by which it was firſt convinced of the Truth of God's Teſtimony touching the Promiſed Benefits, and the Condition and Means of obtaining them, and from a frequent application of it to the Will: And this the Will can do.</p>
                     <p>For, as the Underſtanding hath a power over the Will, ſo far as to repreſent its apprehenſions to the Will in order to its acting thereupon according to a Man's own concerns therein; ſo alſo the Will hath a kind of power over the Underſtanding, both to put it upon frequent conſideration, to ſtrengthen it ſelf in the belief of that which the VVill would have to prove true and to be believed; and alſo to call it off from ſo doing, when there is a great reluctancy in the VVil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt having that prove true which the Underſtanding repreſents as true. And if the Underſtanding be taken off, ſo that it hath not frequent recourſe to that evidence which firſt procured its <hi>Aſſent</hi> unto the Truth of God's Teſtimony in the Goſpel, that it might be thereby nouriſhed, ſtrengthened, and maintained; that Faith in the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding will languiſh and grow weak, and ſo have no powerful opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the VVill to change and renew it, and to procure its effectual conſent to perform the Condition of the Promiſe, when the Will ſtands diſinclined of it ſelf, to the Verdict of the Underſtanding. Beſides, if the Underſtanding doth not <hi>ply</hi> the VVill, and frequently inculcate upon it, its own apprehenſions concerning God's Teſtimony, and the conſequence and concernment of it to a Man's own ſelf, thereby to make the VVord believed to be an <hi>ingrafted Word,</hi> it will not work any Cure upon it, or any thorough change in it.</p>
                     <p>The unwillingneſs in Men to have their Minds ingaged in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of God's ways and their own, is the reaſon of their turning back from him. <hi>Job</hi> 34.27. <hi>They turned back from him, and would not co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ſider any of his ways.</hi> As on the contrary, the Scripture repreſents th converſion of a ſinner as proceeding from the conſideration of the bad tendency of his evil ways. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.28. <hi>Becauſe he conſidereth
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:151517:52"/> and turneth away from all his tranſgreſſions which he hath committed, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not dye.</hi> And our Saviour ſeems to caſt mens profiting, or not profiting; their Belief, or not Belief, by hearing God's Teſtimony in the Goſpel, upon their conſidering, or not conſidering of it. <hi>Mark</hi> 4.24. <hi>And he ſaid unto them, Conſider what you hear</hi> (ſo Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> reads it) <hi>for with what meaſure ye meet</hi> (viz. in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, or not conſidering) <hi>it ſhall be meaſured to you again,</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting, or not profiting; which is to be underſtood according to God's ordinary proceeding with Men.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon why the Faith of thoſe reſembled by the ſtony ground, doth not abide, or come to perfection, is, becauſe they have no Root in themſelves, and that comes to paſs for want of much conſideration, and a frequent working the firſt conviction of the mind from the evidence of Truth, into the Will and Affections, by a conſtant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and cloſe Application of it. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. <hi>They ſearched the Scriptures [daily] whether thoſe things were ſo;</hi> and <hi>therefore they</hi> Believed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When men hold faſt their Luſts, out of their great love to them, notwithſtanding their conviction in their Underſtandings, and are not willing to part with them upon any terms, the Fumes of thoſe Luſts continually aſcending, will cloud and darken the Underſtanding as a thick Fogg doth the Sun, and by degrees make it leſs capable of diſcerning its Object, <hi>viz.</hi> ſaving Truth, in its clear evidence, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably hinder its operation upon the Will. <hi>The cares of this World, and the deceitfulneſs of Riches, and the luſts of other things, choak the Word, and it becometh unfruitful,</hi> Mar. 4.19. <hi>He that hateth his Brother is in darkneſs, and walketh in darkneſs, and knoweth not whether he goes, becauſe darkneſs hath blinded his eyes,</hi> 1 John 2.11.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Sinful Mens Underſtandings are not ſo uncorrupt, but that they are apt to be bribed by their Wills, to caſt about and deviſe how to evade the force and edge of their own Notices and Dictates, and to attempt and baffle their former apprehenſions and convictions, to the end they may ſtill retain their luſts without any great diſturbance from their Underſtandings. This when it is yielded to, and put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, is that which in Scripture is called Mens <hi>cloſing their eyes, leſt at any time they ſhould ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and underſtand with their hearts, and ſhould be converted and healed,</hi> Mat. 13.15. And when this takes place in Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, that do believe that Faith, Repentance, and Obedience are neceſſary to Salvation, as the Condition on which it is promiſed; the way by which they uſually deceive their own Hearts, is, by perſwading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they do perform the Condition of the Promiſe in theſe, when indeed they do not; but frame to themſelves Notions of ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith, Repentance and Obedience, different from the Scripture Notions of them, as I ſhall ſhew in each of them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Many delude themſelves, by taking up a wrong Notion of Saving Faith, and ſo think they have it, when they have it not. They believe indeed Chriſt to be the Son of God, and Saviour of the World, and that thoſe ſhall be ſaved that believe in him, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:151517:52"/> thoſe damned that do not, becauſe the Scripture, which they believe to be the Word of God, ſaith ſo: And thus far they believe rightly objectively. But then they deceive their own Souls, by perſwading themſelves that a meer <hi>Aſſent</hi> of their minds to the Truth of theſe, and other Evangelical Verities, is the Faith to which the promiſed Juſtification and Salvation is made, though it hath no ſuch powerful operation upon their Wills, as to make them new Creatures, to make any thorow change in the temper of their Hearts and tenor of their Lives. And many doubtleſs have been greatly ſtrengthened in this deluſive confidence, by having been taught that Faith juſtifies without any VVorks at all. And theſe again perſwade themſelves, that they believe in Chriſt to the ſaving of their Souls, becauſe they rely on him alone for Salvation, and upon what he hath done, and ſuffered for them, though they love their ſins, and live in them ſtill. Juſt like ſome <hi>Jews</hi> of old, who though they were very bad in their Lives, yet <hi>leaned upon the Lord, and ſaid, is not the Lord among us? None evil can come upon us,</hi> Mich. 3.11. Iſa. 48.1, 2 They leaned upon God's Promiſe of being their God, as thoſe do upon Chriſt's under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to be a Saviour, although they overlooked the Condition to be performed by them in being a People unto him, in loving and ſerving him as thoſe Chriſtians I ſpeak of, alſo do. Though Chriſt alone is to be relyed on for Salvation, as touching all that is proper to the Mediatory Office and VVork, yet no Man is to rely on him, ſo as to think he ſhould excuſe him, if he do not Repent, or be not Regenerate; or as if he did Repent, or were Regenerate for him. If they do; they promiſe themſelves from him, that which he never promiſed, or undertook, but hath told them plainly, That except they themſelves Repent, they ſhall Periſh; and that except they themſelves be Born again, they cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 They deceive their own Hearts alſo in the nature of Repentance; their Notion of it being one thing, and the Scripture-Notion of it quite another: So that tney perſwade themſelves they have Repented, when indeed they have not. They know and believe perhaps Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to be neceſſary to Salvation, becauſe Chriſt hath ſaid, that <hi>except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh</hi> But then they miſtake, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading themſelves that they do repent, becauſe they are frequently ſorry for what they have done, tho' they ceaſe not to do the ſame again. Indeed, when the pleaſure of Sin is over, and rebukes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience come in the room of them; theſe trouble their minds for what they have done, which was the Repentance of <hi>Judas;</hi> and <hi>there is no peace to the wicked, who are like the troubled Sea.</hi> Now this they count Repentance, though it work no effectual and thorow change in Heart and Life; but when that ſad fit is over, they appear to be the ſame Men they were before, by returning to the ſame ſins.</p>
                     <p>And herein the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church hath moſt unhappily laid a Snare, which, as is to be feared, catcheth multitudes of Souls to their Deſtruction, in aſſerting <hi>Contrition,</hi> yea, <hi>Attrition</hi> with Confeſſion, to be Repentance ſufficient to Salvation. VVhereas ſorrow <hi>alone,</hi> though it be <hi>godly ſorrow,</hi> is not Repentance, but as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Godly ſorrow worketh
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:151517:53"/> Repentance,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.10. But Repentance it ſelf, which is Saving, conſiſteth chiefly in a real change in Mens apprehenſions of, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to both Sin and Duty; and in <hi>ceaſing to do evil, and learning to do well.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Others again deceive themſelves in taking a partial Reformation, for true Repentance: Becauſe they have left ſome ſins which they could beſt ſpare, as blemiſhing their Reputation, or impairing their Eſtates, or their Health: And becauſe they have done many things (which yet <hi>Herod</hi> alſo did, <hi>Mar.</hi> 6.) they think they have Repented, and are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, though they retain others which are more gainful, or yield them more pleaſure. VVhereas the ſincerity of Repentance can be nothing leſs then a hatred of, and turning from ſin, as ſin, and ſo from all ſin, by diligent and careful endeavours.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They deceive themſelves by a falſe Notion of that Obedience which is neceſſary to Salvation. They believe in the groſs indeed, that Obedience to the Commands of God, to the Rules and Precepts of the Goſpel, is neceſſary to Salvation, becauſe the Scripture ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declareth it to be ſo: But then they deceive their own Hearts, in thinking and perſwading themſelves that they have performed this part of the Condition of the Promiſe, when as they have not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed one half of it. They have been, it may be, ſomewhat care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be found in acts of External Worſhip and Devotion, both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and private; and to keep themſelves from Idolatry, Swearing, Curſing, Sabbath-breaking, Murder, Adultery, Stealing, Falſe-witneſs-bearing, and the like, in the outward and groſs acts of them. But all the while have made no conſcience of governing their Thoughts, Affections, and Paſſions, nor their Tongues neither, as to many things. And in all this, wherein do they exceed the <hi>Phariſees?</hi> whom if we exceed not in Righteouſneſs, Chriſt hath told us (who beſt knows) that we ſhall never enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.20. They were ſtrict and zealous in the obſervation of the Laws for Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, Sacrifices, Sabbaths, Tythes, and other poſitive Precepts, and that to a tittle: And Faſted often, and made long Prayers, and gave Alms; and made Oſtentation alſo that they were not as others were; Extortioners, Unjuſt, Adutlerers, nor as the <hi>Publicans.</hi> And why would not all this bring them to Heaven? Becauſe all this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding (as they had not Faith in Chriſt, ſo) they were Covetous, Proud, and Ambitious, ſeeking Honour one of another, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and deſpiſing others; they were Envious and Malicious, Cruel and Ill-natured, Unmerciful, and Perſecuting ſuch as faithfully reproved them. They made clean the outſide of the Cup and Platter; and ſo far as they did ſo they did well: But that for which Chriſt denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Woe to them, was, that their <hi>inward part was full of ravening and wickedneſs,</hi> and for want of love to God, and of Judgment, Mercy, and Fidelity.</p>
                     <p>God is a Spirit, and the Service that is acceptable to him, as being moſt agreeable to his Nature, is that which is done <hi>in Spirit and Truth.</hi> And therefore his Precepts are given to govern the inward Man, as well as the outward.</p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:151517:53"/>
                     <p>He that ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> hath ſaid alſo, <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy Brother in thy heart, nor be Angry with him without a cauſe,</hi> or <hi>bear a grudge againſt him.</hi> He that ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery,</hi> hath ſaid alſo, <hi>Thou ſhalt not luſt after a Woman in thy heart.</hi> And he that ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal,</hi> hath ſaid alſo, <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet,</hi> and the like. And therefore, they that think themſelves to be Obedient Children to God, upon account of their abſtaining from outward groſs Sins, and of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing outwardly Righteous, and do not truly endeavour, and make a buſineſs of it to mortifie and ſubdue their Pride, Covetouſneſs, love of the World, Envy, Hatred, Malice, thoughts of Revenge, the unrulineſs of Paſſions, and all immoderate Affections; but indulge themſelves in theſe, or any of theſe, or the like; they deceive themſelves, whatever their External Conformity to Divine Precepts otherwiſe may be. They are <hi>the pure in heart that ſhall ſee God. And they that are Chriſts, have crucified the fleſh, with the affections and luſts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God obſerves more what Men are inwardly, than what they are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly; and judges of them accordingly. <hi>He is not a Jew,</hi> nor he a Chriſtian, <hi>who is one outwardly in the fleſh, but he who is ſo inwardly in heart, whoſe praiſe is not of Men, but of God,</hi> Rom. 2.28, 29. And therefore St. <hi>James</hi> counted them but <hi>Earthly, Senſual, and Deviliſh,</hi> in their Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, how high ſoever they profeſſed, and ſuch as did <hi>lye againſt the Truth,</hi> that indulged <hi>bitter envying and ſtrife,</hi> though it were but <hi>in their hearts,</hi> Jam. 3.14, 15. And if Luſts and Paſſions within ſhall break out in an unbridled Tongue, in Slandering, Reviling, Back-biting, Evil-ſpeaking, raſh and uncharitable Cenſuring, or the like; how Religious ſoever ſuch a Man may otherwiſe ſeem to himſelf, or others, yet St. <hi>James</hi> hath plainly determined his caſe; ſuch an one hath <hi>deceived his own heart, and his Religion is vain,</hi> Jam. 2.26. Mat. 5.22.</p>
                     <p>Men may go a great way in Religion, yea ſo far as until they <hi>are not far from the Kingdom of God.</hi> Yea, <hi>many ſhall ſeek to enter</hi> in, by doing many things in order thereto, and yet <hi>ſhall not be able,</hi> for want of <hi>ſtriving</hi> to do all that is neceſſary thereto. And for that very reaſon, and becauſe of the great danger of Chriſtians falling ſhort, tho' they have gone far, and done much, are they ſo earneſtly Exhorted to <hi>work out,</hi> or to <hi>work through</hi> their own Salvation with Fear and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling; with a fear of falling ſhort, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12. And not only ſo, but to <hi>fear</hi> even a <hi>ſeeming</hi> to come ſhort of the promiſed Reſt. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Let us therefore fear, leſt a promiſe being left us of entering into his Reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it.</hi> The matter is of that huge conſequence, that every wiſe Man that doth not <hi>deſpiſe his own Soul,</hi> ſhould be afraid to do, or omit to do, any thing that hath but the leaſt <hi>ſeeming</hi> ſhew or apperance of putting his Salvation into any hazard. And therefore [All] <hi>diligence</hi> is not too much for the wiſeſt Man living to uſe, to <hi>make his calling and election ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10.</p>
                     <p>Thus when Mens Underſtandings are bribed by their corrupt Wills, they then take up with a partial Faith, a partial Repentance, and a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Obedience, inſtead of that which is Evangelically compleat, and hope it is a fulfilling of the Condition of the Promiſe.</p>

For tho' Faith in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, is the firſt Principle of Action as Chriſtian, yet not that, but the Will, as it is affected with Hope, Fear, or Love, is the next and immediate Principle of Action. The Underſtanding, when it rightly performs its Office, doth not only aſſent unto the Truth of Divine Revelation, upon competent Evidence that it is from God; but alſo conſiders and weighs, as in a balance, the import of it, and how a Man is concerned in it; as whether it betoken Good or Evil to him, and how much, and upon what terms, whether Abſolutely, or Conditionally; and what the Condition is: All which, when brought down to the ſubordinate Faculties of the Soul, the Will and Affections, is apt to affect them, and work upon them more or leſs, according as the things believed are apprehended more or leſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern a Man.</p>

                     <p>And the things believed, Eternal Life, and Eternal Death, in another World, being Inviſible and abſent things; it is a Man's Faith, touching the reality of them, that ſupplies the room or abſence of ſenſe. <hi>For Faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> Heb. 11.1. We neither ſee nor feel the glorious things promiſed, nor the dreadful things threatned in another World, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than by Faith, which gives the Believer a proſpect of them. But a Man by his Faith in that Goſpel by which they are revealed, hath a foreſight of them, (as <hi>Abraham</hi> had of Chriſt's Day) and that fills the Soul with Hope, and Fear, and a ſenſe of God's love, in giving ſuch an Hope. And this Hope, Fear, and Love, puts Men upon, more or leſs, Care, Diligence, and Induſtry, in doing what is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the obtaining of the one, and eſcaping the other, as they are more or leſs influenced by a Faith that is weaker or ſtronger, or more or leſs active and exerciſed about theſe things. And hence comes that change which is made in the Hearts and Lives of true Believers, who <hi>walk by Faith, and not by Sight;</hi> that is, they govern their Lives by the belief of inviſible, and not ſenſible things, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. This in general. But more particularly, the Faith of <hi>Aſſent</hi> in the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, works the Faith of <hi>Conſent</hi> in the Will, by its operation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe three Paſſions, or Affections of the Will, Hope, Fear, and Love.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As a firm aſſenting to the Truth of God's Promiſe through Chriſt, of pardon of Sin, and Eternal Life, upon Condition of Repentance and new Obedience, together with his Faith, gives a Man hope and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of obtaining theſe great benefits upon the terms on which they were promiſed.</p>
                     <p>The hope of this Happineſs, cauſeth a Man to be willing to comply with the Condition upon which it is promiſed, in order to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Happineſs itſelf.</p>
                     <p>There is a Principle of Self-love, planted by God in the Nature of every Man, by which he doth naturally deſire and aſpire after the happineſs of his own Being. And that will put a Man upon the uſe of ſuch Means, and the performance of ſuch a Condition, without which, he believes, and is verily perſwaded, he cannot be happy. Now, every Man in whom there is the Faith of Aſſent unto the Trut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> of God's Teſtimony in the Goſpel, firmly fixed, being verily perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that everlaſting Happineſs is not attainable without Repentance, Regeneration, and ſincere Obedience, becauſe God hath declared this as plainly as he hath done any thing: (And it is the nature of Faith to acquieſce in his Teſtimony.) The love of the End, which is Man's own Happineſs, makes him in love with the Means, ſuch as is Repenting, Mortifying, and Obeying, without which he cannot attain his end in being Happy. This Principle of Self-love under the conduct of a Man's Underſtanding and Reaſon enlightned, and regulated by a Declaration of the Divine Will, and influenced by a firm belief of it, will work in a Man new Apprehenſions of, and new Affections to both Sin and Duty; and will cauſe him to abandon the little <hi>pleaſures of ſin, which are but for a ſeaſon,</hi> that he may come to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:151517:55"/> the fruition of that <hi>fulneſs of joy, and thoſe Rivers of pleaſure, which are in the preſence of God, at his right hand, for evermore;</hi> when once he knows, and firmly believes that they cannot otherwiſe be obtained.</p>
                     <p>Thus by Faith is the <hi>victory over the world</hi> obtained, in all its Temptations, from Honours, Profits, and Pleaſures, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4. For by ſuch a Faith a Man well perceives that the World offers him to his unſpeakable loſs, though it ſhould offer him all of theſe that it is able to confer upon him, if it be upon condition of doing, or omitting to do, that by which he ſhall certainly deprive himſelf of that <hi>Glory, Honour, and Immortality,</hi> which he is well aſſured of, through Faith in God's Promiſe, if he <hi>overcome.</hi>

                     <p>We ſee Men are ſo commonly governed by a Principle of Self-love, in parting with a leſſer Good or Conveniency for a greater, even in the things of this Life, that they are worthily and deſervedly counted Fools that do the contrary: And therefore, thoſe are guilty of ſo much the greater Folly and Madneſs, who deprive themſelves of the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of Heaven, by a ſinful ſeeking or poſſeſſing of the Honours Profits, or Pleaſures of this Life: As the Happineſs of Heaven exceeds the enjoyments of this World, in kind and height of Satisfaction, and in continuance and duration; ſo Rational a thing it is to live and walk by Faith of unſeen things, and Unreaſonable and Unmanly to be governed by the ſenſe of preſent things, in oppoſition thereunto, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.2.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Faith of Aſſent in the Underſtanding, worketh a Conſent in the VVill to the Condition of the Promiſe, as the paſſion of Fear is awakened by believing God's Threatnings againſt ſuch as do not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and fulfil that Condition. There is a Principle of Self-preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion planted by God in every Man's Nature, by which he fears and abhors that which he knows, and verily believes, tends to the infeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and miſery of his Being; and which puts him upon the avoiding of that which he believes hath ſuch a tendency, in order to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining the Miſery, or Deſtruction itſelf.</p>
                     <p>VVhen a Man receives ſuch ſayings into his Underſtanding, as threaten, that, <hi>if ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall die;</hi> that, <hi>except ye repent, ye ſhall all periſh;</hi> that, <hi>without holineſs, no Man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> and the like; and doth Aſſent unto them, as the true ſayings of God, which Aſſent is his Faith; the fear of the Miſery threatned, and the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Self-preſervation, work in him a deſire and endeavour to have his ſinful Inclinations and Appetites Mortified, and a care to avoid the outward acts of ſin, as really and truly as he deſires to eſcape Eternal Deſtruction itſelf; as believing and knowing they tend thereto, and that he cannot eſcape the one, without a ſincere deſire and endeavour to deſtroy and avoid the other.</p>
                     <p>And in this way, Faith is a Believer's <hi>Victory, by which he alſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the World,</hi> when it tempts him to ſin, by threatning him with Diſgrace, loſs of Eſtate, or Liberty, or with enduring of corporal Puniſhment, or Death itſelf. For he believes the Puniſhments in the other VVorld to be of ſuch a nature and duration, as that the worſt things which Man can inflict, are altogether inconſiderable in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:151517:55"/> of them. By which Belief he is ſo far guided, that he chuſes to ſuffer the leſs, when his faithfulneſs to God, and his own beſt intereſt doth expoſe him to it, rather than to expoſe himſelf by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs to infinitely the greater, to avoid the leſs. And thus Faith purifies the Heart of all inordinate Affection to Riches, Honour, Eaſe and Pleaſures, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The Faith of Aſſent or Credence in the Underſtanding, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the exceeding greatneſs of God's Love to Mankind in the gift of Chriſt for their Redemption, and in his great and precious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made in him, upon a very gracious Condition, works in the Will a love to God, and ſo a love to pleaſe him, in doing thoſe things which he hath made the Condition of his Promiſe. When once the Underſtanding repreſents it to the Will, as a certain Truth, upon clear Evidence, that notwithſtanding Mens Apoſtacy from God, and Rebellion againſt him, and the Condemnation they are under thereby; yet God is Reconcilable to them, yea, willing, and ſo deſirous to Reconcile them to himſelf; that, as an Evidence and Proof of it, he hath given his own Son Chriſt Jeſus, to become <hi>a Ranſom for them;</hi> and that he hath made a new Covenant, declaring that upon account of his Son's undertaking for them, he is not only abundantly willing to pardon all ſuch as ſhall unfeignedly Repent of their diſloyalty, and ſincerely return to their Duty; but that he will alſo bountifully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their future ſincere Obedience, with perfect and perpetual Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: I ſay, when all this is repreſented to the Will, as unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably true, it will work in it a love to that God and Saviour, that hath been ſo loving, if it be but kept cloſe to it. A manifeſtation of ſuch love and goodneſs to Man, and that while yet in enmity againſt God, ſo ill deſerving, and ſo obnoxious to <hi>the power of his wrath;</hi> when he hath no need of him, nor can be profited by him, will create good thoughts of God, and reconcile Man's Mind to him, and work melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Affections in him to God, when heartily believed.</p>
                     <p>What Rebel is there, or nature ſo bad, that would not be won to leave off Rebelling againſt his Prince, and to love and pleaſe him upon undoubted aſſurance, that by ſo doing he ſhould not only be pardoned, and reſtored to Favour, but alſo perferred to the greateſt Honour and Happineſs he is capable of receiving from any Mortal? And yet how weak a motive is this in compariſon of what comes from God, to reduce Men to their love and loyalty to him? God's love to Man, when perceived, and heartily believed, is the great motive, and attractive of Man's Love to God. <hi>We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.19. Love is an active and commanding Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in Man, and procureth Thoughts, Cares, and Endeavours of pleaſing God. <hi>If any Man love me, he will keep my words,</hi> ſaith our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.23. And after this manner, <hi>Faith worketh by Love,</hi> Gal. 5.6.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have repreſented to you, how, and after what manner, Faith in the Underſtanding works a ſaving Conſent in the Will, unto the Condition of God's Covenant of Salvation.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Some few Objections anſwered.</head>
                     <p n="1">I. SOME have thought Men may be Juſtified only by their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, even while they are Ungodly in their Lives; and have thought that Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. will hear them out in ſuch a conceit, which ſaith, <hi>He that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his Faith is counted for Righteouſneſs.</hi> But they groſly miſtake the Scripture, and deceive themſelves. For that Text ſpeaks of God's Juſtifying the <hi>Gentiles</hi> upon their ſincere conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Chriſtian Faith and Life, though they had lived in <hi>Gentiliſm,</hi> in all Ungodlineſs before, and until then, and though they ſhould not work at all, as the Judaizers would have had them, in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Proſelytes</hi> to the Jewiſh way. But otherwiſe, it's flatly againſt the expreſs Doctrine of the Goſpel, and current of the Scriptures, for Men to hope to be pardoned by any Believing whatſoever, while they remain Impenitent; as every Man doth while he remains Ungodly. <hi>To juſtifie the wicked, is an abomination to the Lord.</hi> It's ſaid that Chriſt made the Blind to See, and the Deaf to Hear, and the Dumb to Speak; as well as it's ſaid, God Juſtifieth the Ungodly. But is any Man ſo ſenſeleſs as to think that Chriſt made them to See, to Hear, and to Speak, while they remained Blind, Deaf, and Dumb? And if not, but that they know the meaning is, that Chriſt made thoſe to See, to Hear, to Speak, which had been Blind, Deaf, and Dumb, before thoſe Cures were wrought upon them; they might as well know alſo, that the meaning is, that God juſtifieth thoſe upon their believing, which had been Ungodly until then, and not that he juſtifies them while they remain Ungodly.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Some alledge, that although the Faith which is alone, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the concomitant effects of it, Repentance, Regeneration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth not juſtifie; yet that Faith <hi>alone</hi> which doth produce ſuch effects, doth juſtifie without the concurrence of theſe in the juſtifying Act. Which they illuſtrate by this Similitude. A Man ſees with his Eye alone, though he doth not ſee with his Eye that is alone, or ſeparated from his Body. In return to all which, let theſe things be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They that go thus far, do grant that which will ſecure the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the neceſſity of Repentance, Regeneration, and new Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto Juſtification. They grant we ſee ſuch a neceſſity of theſe, as without which no Man can be juſtified, no not by Faith. In grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, though we ſuppoſe them to err in their foreſaid Notion, yet this makes their Error the leſs dangerous; becauſe the preſence
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:151517:56"/> of Repentance, Regeneration, and Obedience, are no leſs neceſſary to Juſtification, according to this account, than they eſteem them to be, who ſay they concur with Faith in the very act of Juſtification.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When they ſay, Faith alone is all that is neceſſary to the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Act, without the concurrence of any thing elſe done by us: By Juſtifying Act, they mean either God's Act, or Man's Act. If Man's Act, that's nothing but Man's performing the Condition upon which God hath promiſed to Juſtifie Men. If they mean God's Act, it is his imputing Mens performing the Condition of the Promiſe unto them for Righteouſneſs. The only thing then in queſtion will be, what it is which is a fulfilling of the Condition of the Promiſe of Juſtification, which God imputes for Righteouſneſs? If they ſay, it is only the Aſſent of the Underſtanding unto the Truth of God's Teſtimony in the Goſpel; or this Aſſent, together with a Reliance on Chriſt for Salvation: I have ſhewed before, that both theſe may be found in Men Unregenerate, and Unjuſtified: And that theſe two of themſelves, without Repentance and hearty Obedience to the Laws of Chriſt, are not a fulfilling of the Condition of the Promiſe, and that conſequently Men, without theſe, cannot be juſtified by any Faith whatſoever; and ſo not by Faith alone; unleſs they will call Repentance and Heart-Obedience, in conjunction with the foreſaid Aſſent of the Mind and reliance of the Soul, by the name of Faith: Which if they will, we are agreed as to the Thing at leaſt, if not to the Name, that we are juſtified by ſuch a Faith alone. And yet I doubt not, that whenever Juſtification is promiſed to Believing ſingly and alone expreſt, but that there the foreſaid effects are comprehended under the name alſo, for the Reaſons formerly given.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They which ſay, we are juſtified by Faith alone, but not by that Faith which is alone, do diſtinguiſh, where the Scripture doth not diſtinguiſh: The Scripture no where ſaith, we are juſtified by Faith alone, as contradiſtinguiſhed from Repentance, Evangelical Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The third Chapter of <hi>Rom.</hi> 28. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times made uſe of to countenance their Notion; but to how little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, hath been ſhewed already in the Treatiſe, which needs not be here repeated.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Scripture is not only ſilent in the caſe, not any where affirming we are juſtified by Faith alone; but it expreſly affirms the quite contrary. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Ye ſee then how that by Works a Man is juſtified, and not by Faith only.</hi> That this is affirmed in reference to our Juſtification before God, had been ſhewed before.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Faith and Repentance are a joint Condition upon which Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is ſuſpended, and are both conſtituted ſo by the ſame means, and that is by promiſe of pardon to ſuch as do Believe, to ſuch as do Repent, and by threatning the contrary to thoſe that do not both. And if they are a joint Condition of the Promiſe of Juſtification, then Juſtification proceeds not upon either of them alone, but upon both together.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Whereas it is ſaid in the Similitude, that a Man ſees with his Eye alone, though not with his Eye which is alone, or when it is

                        <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:151517:58"/> alone. I doubt this is no more true, than that which is intended to be illuſtrated by it. For Naturaliſts will tell them the contrary, That it is not the Eye alone, by which a Man ſees, but that it is the Soul that ſees by the Eye as its Organ. The Eye ſees not when the Soul is departed, though it be not then alone. I confeſs, I cannot poſſibly conceive either how the Soul ſhould not concur with the Eye, in the Act of ſeeing, when the Eye cannot ſee without it; nor yet that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance ſhould not concur with Faith, in the Act of Juſtification, ſo long as Men cannot be Juſtified by Faith it ſelf without it, or in the abſence of it, as they themſelves grant.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This lies in the way of ſome; they cannot conceive how Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Evangelical Obedience, as well as Faith, ſhould conſiſt with the poſſibility of ſomes being juſtified by Believing, who yet may not live ſo long after, as to have an opportunity of doing good Works.</p>
                     <p>How rare Inſtances of this kind are, I ſhall not diſpute: But doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, whenever Men ſo believe God's Promiſe of pardon through Chriſt upon their Repentance, and the neceſſity of their own Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for the obtaining of it, as that they in VVill, and a fixed and laſting Reſolution, become new Men, then they firſt believe unto Juſtification. And it is not impoſſible but that ſome may ſo believe, that may never after they do ſo have opportunity to be much active in External Acts of Obedience. But though this ſhould ſo fall out, yet ſuch are not juſtified without Evangelical Obedience as well as Faith. For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Theſe Motions and Acts of the VVill, are themſelves Acts of preſent Evangelical Obedience.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They are in the Root and Cauſe, Evangelical Obedience future, and to come.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> They are in themſelves Acts of preſent Evangelical Obedience. For by theſe Motions and Acts of the VVill, Men do, whenever they take place, turn from Sin to God and their Duty, out of Hatred to that they turn from, and out of Love to that they turn to. And theſe Acts of the VVill, which conſiſt in Affection and Reſolution, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per effects and fruits of Faith in the Underſtanding, and Acts of Heart-Obedience in the ſight of God, and a conformity of Soul to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared VVill and Commandment. And they may as well, and as truly be called VVorks, as evil Acts of the VVill may, ſuch as are a love to evil, and deſires and reſolutions of perpetrating it: VVhich evil Acts of the VVill, are yet in Scripture called VVorks, and a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of wickedneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.2. <hi>Ye work wickedneſs in your Hearts,</hi> Micah. 2.1. <hi>He that looketh upon a Woman to luſt after her, hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted adultery with her already in his heart,</hi> Matth. 5.28. And <hi>envy, wrath, and hatered,</hi> which are Internal Acts of the Soul, are called VVorks of the Fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 20, 21. And if ſuch inward fixed Reſolutions in Men, of obeying God in external Acts, if ever they have opportunity and a Call to it, did not paſs in God's account for Obedience, and were not accepted inſtead of the Deed, when oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for the Deed is wanting, the beſt Man in the World could be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:151517:58"/> no Diſciple of Chriſt, who doth not actually forſake all that he hath, and lay down his Life for him. <hi>Whoſoever of you forſaketh not all that he hath, cannot be my Diſciple,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26, 33. Whereas Chriſt pronounceth the Poor in Spirit, Bleſſed; many of whom never became actually Poor for his ſake, as not being called to it. But if they are Poor in Spirit, if they firmly reſolve to become Poor, in forſaking all for Chriſt's ſake, when called to it, theſe are capable of Bleſſedneſs in Chriſt's account, as well as thoſe that ſuffer the loſs of all for Righteouſneſs ſake, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.3.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thoſe Acts of the Will, are, in the Root and Cauſe, Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Obedience future, and to come: Becauſe thoſe Reſolutions againſt evil, and for good, when they are of a fixed and laſting nature, (as they always are, when, together with Faith, they make Men capable of Juſtification) will certainly produce external Acts of ſincere Obedience, as opportunity doth occur.</p>
                     <p>When the Tree is made good, it will bring forth good Fruit in the ſeaſon of Fruit, if it be not cut down before. When the Heart is renewed in affection and reſolution, the courſe of a Man's Life will certainly be anſwerable to it, if ever it have opportunity of ſhewing it. <hi>A good Man, out of the good treaſure of his heart, bringeth forth good things,</hi> Mat. 12.35. And God who knows the Heart, doth judge of, and eſtimate Men according to what they are in the inward frame of their Heart, and prevalent bent of their Wills. <hi>If there be firſt a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a Man hath, and not according to that he hath not,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.12. We judge of the Cauſe, by the Effects; of the goodneſs of Mens Hearts by the goodneſs of their Lives; to us the Tree is known by its Fruit: But God who is greater than our Hearts, and knows them better than we do, judges of the Effect by the Cauſe, and knows what a Mans Life will be, by what his Heart is, upon its firſt Converſion to him; and ſo confers on him the benefit of Juſtification, when the Foundation of a good Life is laid in the converſion and renewing of the Heart.</p>
                     <p>The Underſtanding of this Part of Diſcourſe, will ſerve not only to ſatisfy the foreſaid Doubt, but alſo to inform us what Evangelical Obedience is neceſſary to Juſtification in its beginning. Not but that actual Obedience in Life is neceſſary to the continuance of Juſtification, where Life is continued. And therefore we find that <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by his after-believing, and after-obedience, as well as by his firſt; and ſo was <hi>Noah</hi> before him. <hi>Noah</hi> was a Righteous Man, and juſtified before <hi>he became heir of the Righteouſneſs which is by Faith,</hi> by his believing and obeying God, in preparing the Ark, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. It was by Faith in God's Promiſe that <hi>Abraham</hi> left his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to obey God at the firſt, and by that he was firſt juſtified, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.8. And yet his believing God's Promiſe, <hi>ſo ſhall thy Seed be,</hi> which was not made till ſome years after, was imputed to him alſo for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.9. It was many years after that again, that by Faith he offered his Son <hi>Iſaac</hi> upon the Altar, and yet by that he was
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:151517:59"/> juſtified as well as by his firſt Faith and Obedience, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.21. Pardon of ſin, is our Juſtification from ſin, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39. And this we are directed by the Lord's Prayer, to pray for daily all our days. And the continuance of Juſtification is promiſed upon condition of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of Faith and Obedience to the Goſpel, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21, 22, 23. and a diſcontinuance of it threatned in caſe of diſobedience, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Tenour of the Parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. from <hi>ver.</hi> 23. to <hi>ver.</hi> 35. By all which we may ſee what need there is for all Chriſtians to <hi>work out,</hi> to work through <hi>their own Salvation with fear and trembling,</hi> to which they are earneſtly exhorted, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.22. and <hi>to run ſo, that they may obtain,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.24.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. Some to evil affect their own and others Minds with prejudice againſt Diſcourſes of this nature, do ſuggeſt, That the laying ſo great a ſtreſs upon Duty, as to eſteem any thing of it neceſſary to Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſave Believing only, doth derogate from the Glory of Chriſt's great Undertaking in the buſineſs of Man's Salvation; and that it is a truſting in our own Righteouſneſs. But it will appear far otherwiſe, if they will but impartially conſider in what ſence, and upon what account ſuch ſtreſs is laid upon Duty; which I ſhall open in two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They that rightly underſtand themſelves in this matter, do not look that any of their Duties, of what nature ſoever, ſhould of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as ſuch, be available to their Juſtification or Salvation; but that it is for the ſake of Chriſt, and upon account of his Undertaking for us, that God accepts and imputes for Righteouſneſs to us, ſuch Duty as Faith, Repentance, and Obedience is, and that he doth make promiſe of Juſtification upon Condition of theſe.</p>
                     <p>Since the Fall, we ſay, all our Duties that are acceptable to God, or available to us, become ſo through Chriſt, and for his ſake. And therefore, ſo long as we attribute and aſcribe the benefit we expect upon our Repentance, and ſincere Obedience, or Belief, unto Chriſt, and to his great and worthy Undertaking for us; we are far from dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating from the Glory of it, and from truſting in our own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in that Notion in which Mens truſting in their own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is condemned in Scripture, or any otherwiſe than as our Duty is made a Condition, without which we ſhall have no part in Chriſt, nor be qualified for Glory.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When we lay ſuch ſtreſs upon Repentance, Obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as a Condition, or part of a Condition of the Promiſe of Juſtification and Salvation, as without which we ſay, we cannot be Juſtified or Saved by Chriſt's Undertaking for us; yet then, this ſtreſs is laid, and depends upon the Will and Appointment of God, by which theſe Duties are thus made the Condition, and not on the intrinſick worth or value of the Duties themſelves ſimply conſidered, without reference to God's Ordination, appointing them to that uſe. For if God had
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:151517:59"/> not made a New Covenant, promiſing pardon for Chriſt's ſake to ſuch as do Repent, and Acceptance and Reward to ſuch as ſincerely Obey him, they would have had no ſufficient ground to have been confident of Pardon, Acceptance, or Reward, though they ſhould have Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſo Obey'd. And the reaſon is, becauſe Men are not Juſtified in the Eye of the Natural or Moral Law, upon any ſuch account as that is. So that all the ſtreſs which is laid on Duty by them that rightly underſtand their Duty in this matter, doth terminate partly in Chriſt's Undertaking for them, and partly in God's Inſtitution, and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who hath made his Promiſe of Juſtifying us for Chriſt's ſake ſo, as that he hath made our Duty of Repentance, and ſincere Obedience, a neceſſary Condition of it. And he that truſteth to be Pardoned, Accepted, and Rewarded for Chriſt's Sake upon his Repentance, and ſincere Obedience, becauſe God hath promiſed that he ſhall; truſteth in God, and in the fidelity of his Word and Promiſe. And in doing ſo, what more ſtreſs doth he lay upon Duty in this kind, than they that truſt to be Juſtified and Saved upon their Believing? For their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving is matter of Duty, as well as their Repenting and Obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And their Believing would no more have entitled them to the benefit without the Promiſe, which gives them that Title, than other Acts of Duty would do. And other Acts of Duty do entitle to the ſame benefits as fully as Faith itſelf doth, where there is promiſe of the ſame benefits annexed to them, as Faith hath: And that they have, I have ſhewed before. So long then as the ſtreſs which is laid on Duty, terminates in Chriſt, and in God's Will and Appointment in the New Covenant, and is regulated by his Word and Promiſe, there is no danger of overcharging Duty.</p>
                     <p>It's true indeed, if we ſhould expect that Duty ſhould do that for us, which is proper only to Chriſt, as to expiate our ſin, or the like; we ſhould ſinfully overcharge it, as the Phariſaical <hi>Jews</hi> did their Sacrifices and other Legal Obſervances, in expecting remiſſion of Sin by them, without Chriſt's Atonement: Which Righteouſneſs of theirs, is for that cauſe called their own Righteouſneſs, which was by the Law, as being no method of Juſtification of God's appointment, but of their own deviſing, which in that reſpect, was indeed <hi>but as filthy Rags,</hi> and loathſome to God. But this is not the caſe with Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Chriſtians, who lay no ſuch ſtreſs upon Duty, no not upon Faith itſelf; but do acknowledge that all the power and virtue it hath to juſtifie, depends wholly upon, and is derived from the Will and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God in Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.40. and 1.12. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. And we ſay the ſame of Repentance, and ſincere Obedience alſo. And a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of being ſaved in a way of Duty upon ſuch terms, is repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Scripture, as truſting in the <hi>Righteouſneſs of God through Faith,</hi> in oppoſition to ones truſting in his own Righteouſneſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. ſo far is it from truſting in our own Righteouſneſs, or from dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating from Chriſt in the Glory of his Undertaking for us.</p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:151517:60"/>
                     <p>And now for a Concluſion: It would be conſidered, whether ſuch as are educated in Chriſtianity, are not hardlier brought to live as becomes the Goſpel in point of Practice, than to believe that Chriſt Jeſus came into the World to ſave Sinners: and that he Died for them, and Roſe again: And whether there is not cauſe to fear, that very many more ſuch do eternally miſcarry through neglect of the former, than for want of the latter: And if there be, as doubtleſs there is, then Practical Diſcourſes among ſuch muſt needs be highly neceſſary, however ſome of weak minds, thirſt more after Diſcourſes Conſolatory upon account of Believing only. Which may ſerve inſtead of an Apology for writing this Diſcourſe. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> charged <hi>Titus</hi> to <hi>affirm</hi> this <hi>[conſtantly]</hi> that they which have Believed, be careful to maintain good Works, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.8.</p>

                  <p>HAving your Lordſhip's Commands for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of theſe following Diſcourſes, I have reaſon to hope my Readers will prove candid and favourable in their Cenſures, ſince they cannot but pay the greateſt Deference to the Judgment of a Prelate, whom all the Learned, both at home and abroad, do Unanimouſly rank amongst the Greateſt Divines, that this, or former Ages can glory in. But that I may not too much leſſen that Eſteem, which the Judicious part of Mankind, at leaſt, do juſtly bear to your Lordſhip, as the niceſt Judge in Things of this Nature, by Proclaiming to the World that Encouragement you have given to a Work, which no doubt will be found very defective: I am apt to believe, and am forward to own it, that it might be more your Approbation of the Deſign, than the Goodneſs
<pb facs="tcp:151517:62"/> of the Performance, that has made your Lordſhip ſo exceedingly Kind to it, and its Author. And indeed if ever there were a Neceſſity of attempting any thing to promote Catechetical Inſtruction, there is now too ſad an Occaſion for it.</p>
                  <p>Some Years ſince we thought it ſufficiently hard upon us, that we were put to the trouble of Defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Church, ſo excellently Conſtituted as ours is, by ſuſteining thoſe ſlight Skirmiſhes made only upon its Outworks; namely, againſt its Rites and Ceremonies (Solemnities I would rather call 'em) ſo wiſely order'd for the more grave and ſolemn Adminiſtration of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip, and for the better Edification of the Souls of Men. But alas, the Enemy has now enter'd through our Breaches into the very Heart of our City (as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls the Church of God.) And as if there were an Univerſal Conſpiracy made at this time againſt it, <hi>All</hi> the Grand and Fundamental Articles, both of Natural and Revealed Religion, are now either moſt furiouſly Storm'd by Atheiſts, Deiſts, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians on the one hand, or ſecretly and dangerouſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined by Enthuſiaſts and Antinomians on the other. And if the next Generation ſhould grow worſe in its Principles and Morals than the preſent, what Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from Heaven, even to the removing of our Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, may we not fear? But eſpecially, what Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from God may not we of the Clergy dread, ſhould we ſuffer the Youth of our Nation to go abroad into the World, without having firſt given 'em thoſe Religious Impreſſions by good Principles, as will guard 'em from the Danger thereof; and, eſpecially, without having firſt prepoſſeſs'd the Minds of ſuch, with a deep Tincture of Divine Knowledge, as are likely t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:151517:62"/> a fatal Miſtake in Education, are generally brought up in thoſe Undiſciplin'd Societies, amongst whom the <hi>Oracles</hi> of falſe and pretended <hi>Reaſon</hi> are more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally Read, and more highly Applauded, than the <hi>Lively Oracles of Divine Revelation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know how deeply ſenſible your Lordſhip is of the growing Infidelity and Heterodoxy of this Age; and how much it is your Opinion, that a conſtant Courſe of Catechizing our Youth in the Fundamental Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſtianity, is the only Means that can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually obviate and cure thoſe Great and Prevailing Evils. And if what I have here offered to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, may be at all Serviceable to any of my Brethren, in affording ſome uſeful Materials for their own Compoſures of this kind, and in aſſiſting any of 'em in their Method, I have my End, and ſhall therein in ſome meaſure anſwer, I preſume, your Lordſhip's Deſign; who, out of a pious Zeal to have this Work of Catechizing univerſally ſet forwards by every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Miniſter in your Dioceſs, would have the way ſo plain'd, that we might all proceed therein without Interruption.</p>
                  <p>And ſure where the Authoritative Injunctions of ſo Great a Father and Governour of our Church, are join'd with ſuch an unparallel'd Induſtry in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of all the moſt important and difficult Duties of the Epiſcopal Care, it is impoſſible for us, who are under the Influence of your Power and Example, to be Remiſs in that which is the very principal part of Miniſterial Inſtruction incumbent upon us. For if we no ſooner ſaw your Lordſhip entring upon that Dioceſs, to which you were Tranſlated ſo Happily to us (though ſo Diſadvantageouſly to your own Fortunes) but we ſaw you apply your ſelf with the utmoſt Vigour to the
<pb facs="tcp:151517:63"/> Buſineſs of it, in Viſiting not only your Clergy, but Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral, Schools, and Hoſpitals. If in your Lordſhip's primary Viſitation we heard ſuch a Learned Scriptural Proof of the <hi>JUS DIVINUM</hi> of the THREE DISTINCT ORDERS, (and what Evidence of that Nature is not to be expected from One ſo Mighty in the Holy Scriptures) as cannot but Silence all Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, and all the Learned of our Nation would be glad to ſee made publick: If we alſo ſaw at the ſame time that Venerable Ordinance of <hi>Confirmation</hi> (even amongst thoſe vaſt Crouds that came to it, and with ſo great a Fatigue to your ſelf) Administer'd with a particular Application of the Stipulatory part, to every Individual Perſon, that was duly atteſted to be ſufficiently Qualified; and with that Order, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and Solemnity, which raiſed in all, who were preſent, that Value for it, which is due to it: If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt every EMBER we ſee thoſe wiſe Precautions uſed, with Reference to the Candidates for Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as would effectually prevent the Admiſſion of Perſons unworthy, upon the account of any Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, or will wholly lay the Guilt at the Doors of thoſe who are backward to Inform their Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of the Miſcarriages they know, in order to their Correction and Remedy; and yet are moſt apt to raiſe their Outcries againſt the Scandals of the Clergy: And if alſo in the Probation of thoſe who are permitted to ſtand Candidates, there is conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch a Treaſury of Sacred Learning open'd to 'em in your Explications of Holy Writ, as renders thoſe Examinations one of the moſt learned and uſeful Theological Exerciſes that this Age does know; and is alone ſufficient to render thoſe in a good meaſure Qualified with Scriptural Knowledge, who come not
<pb facs="tcp:151517:63"/> thereto altogether prepar'd before-hand. And indeed, if agreeably to your Lordſhip's ſo uſeful Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, thoſe who have the Happineſs to be Converſant with you in your Studies, do always ſee you Searching the Scriptures, and do ſcarcely ever find you without the Holy Bible before you; (though one would think the ſacred Page need be no more turn'd over by one, who ſeems to have it wholly by Heart already, both in our own, and all the Learned Languages.) If farther yet we have ſeen your Lordſhip, by a Method equally worthy to be admired and imitated, in ſo ſhort time, to have got ſuch an exact Knowledge of a numerous Clergy, that from the chiefeſt Rector to the meaneſt Curate, our Abilities, Lives, and Miniſterial Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, ſeem not to be better known to our neareſt Neighbours, than to your Self; and our Miſcarriages and Neglects of Duty in the remoteſt Part of your Dioceſs, may almoſt as ſoon eſcape the Reproaches of our own Conſciences, as your Lordſhip's Notice and Animadverſion: If in a word ſuch is your Lordſhip's Vigilance through all the Parts of a very large Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, as is alone ſufficient to Confute thoſe Voluminous Libels which were wrote ſome Years ſince against <hi>DIOCESAN EPISCOPACY,</hi> as if an exact Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline were not practicable therein: If I ſay, ſuch an Authority will not awe us, nor ſuch an Example of Paſtoral Care will not animate us to diſcharge, as all the other, ſo eſpecially ſuch an indiſpenſably neceſſary a part of our Miniſterial Function as Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing (particularly at this Juncture) undoubtedly is, this were enough to provoke Heaven to ſnatch from us the vaſt Benefit of ſuch a Paternal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Which Bleſſing that God may however con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to this Church, as it is heartily deſired by all

                  <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>HAving a Deſign, if God permit, and if I ſhall find this preſent Performance to be Candid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received, to Publiſh a Diſcourſe upon the <hi>Nature and Extent of Miniſterial, more particularly of Catechetical Inſtruction,</hi> which in the Nature of it, I think, would be the moſt proper Preface to this Work; but is a Porch too large to be prefix'd to one ſingle Wing of the Building; I ſhall only at preſent Advertiſe my Reader of Two Particulars, relating to this Firſt Volume of my Lectures; namely,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whereas I propoſed, Lecture the Fourth, in the Diviſion of the Subject-Matter contained in theſe Preliminary Queſtions and Anſwers, to treat both upon Divine Grace, and of Prayer, as they are the Means to enable us to perform our Part of the Covenant; and alſo to explain the Doctrine, and to juſtify the Thing it ſelf of <hi>Infant Baptiſm,</hi> or the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of Perſons into Covenant in the time of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy; as alſo the Uſe of <hi>Godfathers</hi> and <hi>Godmothers</hi> therein, I was advis'd by ſome Learned Men to refer thoſe Four laſt Points, and the Lectures upon them, rather to the latter end of the Catechiſm; the Two former to be treated upon, when I come to the <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> and the Queſtion which leads to it; the Two latter when I ſhall come to the Doctrine of
<pb facs="tcp:151517:65"/> the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> where my Diſcourſes upon thoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects will be founded upon Queſtions and Anſwers more directly leading thereunto. And as to the Subject of <hi>Renouncing the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil,</hi> it was thought it might be of good Uſe to enlarge upon that, there being nothing of vaſter Concernment, eſpecially to Youth, than a plain and practical Diſcovery of thoſe various Temptations which will ariſe from all theſe our Spiritual Adverſaries, and are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to aſſault them above others. And becauſe this Condition in our Covenant with God, of Renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh, does not again recurr in any part of the Catechiſm to be more particularly handled, as the others of Faith and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience do; for theſe Reaſons it is, that my Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of that Point has run out into a length ſo much improportionable to the reſt, inſomuch that that Part takes up half the Book.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That which in the next place I am to account for, is the 23d. Lecture; which is an Epitome of a Book, ſtyl'd, the <hi>Meaſures of Chriſtian Obedience,</hi> a Work, I preſume, both well known and eſteem'd. That Reverend Author, had, in my Opinion, given ſo full a ſtate of the Condition of our Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Obedience, that I thought I ſhould do an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to my <hi>Catechumen,</hi> ſhould I paſs it by, and give him a worſe, and more imperfect one of my own. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it would have been eaſier to me to contract that Diſcourſe, than to make a new ſtate of the Point, ſuch as I might call my own, I cannot readily gueſs; but if it was, I hope ſome allowance will be given for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one ſuch Reſt as this may appear to be, ſince in the whole Scheme of Doctrine upon theſe <hi>Prelimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Queſtions and Anſwers,</hi> I have been forc'd to tread in ſomething an unbeaten Path.</p>
                  <p>And now with my earneſt Prayers to God, that he would give his Bleſſing to what is herein no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than honeſtly deſign'd, I ſhall only at preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
<pb facs="tcp:151517:65"/> the candid Reader, to put a favourable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction upon what has been here offer'd him, by one who is too ſenſible of his own Inſufficiencies, to be pertinacious in Maintaining any thing againſt the ſenſe of his Superiors; but eſpecially who is Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly careful to advance nothing contrary to the Doctrine of our Church: Which that I might not do, I have, and ſhall all along endeavour to take in as much as I can, both of Matter and Expreſſion from its eſtabliſh'd Forms and Offices.</p>

In this, I ſay, conſiſts One main Part of Religion, in abſtaining from all Sin and Wickedneſs, and in a conſtant and ſteddy Performance of all the Parts of Vertue and Holineſs.</p>
                  <p>This, I am ſure, is a main Part of the Chriſtian Religion, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that our Saviour came to Plant amongſt Men, for this St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>The Grace of God that bringeth Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to all men hath appeared, teaching us that denying ungodlineſs and worldly Luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world; looking for that bleſſed Hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works.</hi> He appeared teaching us to deny all Ungodlineſs; and he gave himſelf for us to redeem us from all Iniquity. Hitherto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed tended all he ſaid, all he did, and all he ſuffer'd. This was the Deſign of his Excellent Sermons and Diſcourſes, of his moſt admirable Example and Life, and of his Death and Sufferings, to Root out of the Lives of Men whatſoever is ſinful and wicked, and to Implant in its ſtead all the Parts of Vertue and Goodneſs.</p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:151517:77"/>
                  <p>But Secondly, It is not enough to make a Man a good Chriſtian,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> To Act Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly upon Chriſtian Principles.</note> that he live a ſtrict and unblamable Life; but it is moreover neceſſary to render him ſuch, that he act Virtuouſly upon Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: Both indeed are neceſſary to the conſtituting a Man a true Chriſtian. The moſt regular Life that can be, except it be acted upon Chriſtian Principles, is but meer Morality at the beſt; as the moſt Orthodox Belief that is, if it be Barren in good Works, is but a dead Faith. Thus Temperance may be obſerv'd becauſe of our Health, and plain and punctual Dealing by the Men of Trade, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their Intereſt. Men may Faſt and Pray out of Hypocriſy, and to appear Good to others; and may diſtribute large Alms to gain the Applauſe of Men, as you may ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.2, 5. And indeed conſidering that <hi>Godlineſs is profitable for all things, having the promiſe of the Life that now is,</hi> as well as <hi>of that which is to come,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8. And ſince of the Chriſtian Religion it may be ſaid, that <hi>Her ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace;</hi> Men may lead very blameleſs Lives in all reſpects, becauſe of the Advantage and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of Mind, that ariſes meerly from a regular and orderly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation: But all this will be accounted by God to fall far ſhort of the Chriſtian Religion, and will entitle the Man to no Reward in Heaven, that acts upon no better Reaſons nor Motives than theſe: <hi>Verily I ſay unto you they have their Reward,</hi> ſays our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.2.</p>
                  <p>Nay, He that lives an orderly, good, moral Life upon the Belief only that there is a God, that his Providence and Care is extended over us, that our Souls ſhall never Dye, but are capable of, and ſhall receive Rewards, or Puniſhments in another World, can be only ſaid to be ſo far Religious, as the good Moral Heathens were, who Believ'd and Acted upon the Principles of Natural Religion only; and who <hi>having no other Law did by Nature the things contain'd in the Law,</hi> Rom. 2, 14. But to conſtitute a Man truly Religious, and to denominate his Religion the Chriſtian Religion, it is farther neceſſary, that he more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over act upon Chriſtian Principles, ſuch as not the Light of Nature only, but the Goſpel of our Saviour does reveal unto us, for <hi>In the day when he ſhall judge the ſecrets of men by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> it will be, St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>according to his Goſpel,</hi> Rom. 2.16. And ſo main a part in his Goſpel were the Principles of reveal'd Religion, that he told the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> he <hi>determined not to know any thing amongſt them ſave Jeſus Chriſt, and him Crucified,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.2. that is, the Means and Methods of our Salvation by a Crucified Saviour (which can be known only by Revelation) he was reſolv'd ſhould be ſo much the Subject of his Preaching amongſt them, that they might almoſt conclude he himſelf knew nothing elſe, and did not much care whether they did alſo. Thus the Chriſtian Religion, you ſee, is out of Chriſtian Principles to lead an holy, good Life.</p>
                  <p>Nor Thirdly, Is it enough to render the Religion of us Chriſtians compleat,<note place="margin">

For alas! the beſt of us all muſt conſider this, That when we have done all that is commanded us, we are but <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nprofitable ſervants,</hi> Luk. 17.10. But alas! the beſt of us all do exceedingly fail in doing all that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

And therefore, as there is <hi>One Mediator between God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5. So we are ſtrictly commanded, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.17. that <hi>whatſoever we do in word or in deed, we ſhould do all in the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> And particularly as to that ſo conſiderable part of Religion, <hi>Prayer,</hi> it is ordain'd, we are told <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.16. <hi>That whatſoever we ſhall ask of the Father in his Name he will give it us:</hi> And alſo as to that other great Duty of Chriſtian Worſhip, <hi>Thankſgiving,</hi> we are ſolemnly enjoyn'd <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.17.20. <hi>As we will ſhew our ſelves not to be unwiſe, but underſtanding what the will of the Lord is, to give thanks always for all things unto God the Father, in the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> and <hi>In him we have boldneſs and acceſs with confidence by the Faith of him,</hi> Eph. 3.12. The meaning of which, and innumerable other places, that might be produc'd to this purpoſe, is this, That conſidering our own Vileneſs and Unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by reaſon of our Sins, we ſhould ground all our Hopes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of Favour and Acceptance, and Reward, ſolely upon Chriſt: That we ſhould offer all our Deeds to God, as Sacrifices and Services unworthy of acceptance in themſelves, and as proceeding from us, but pleaſing and acceptable to God, only for his ſake.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance the Distinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Character of a true Chriſtian.</note>And now this I take to be the grand diſtinguiſhing Character of Chriſtianity, which ought therefore never to be omitted, when we pretend to give a full Account thereof. As to a good Moral Life, ſome Pagans did arrive to great degrees in Vertue (ſuch as I wiſh may not riſe in Judgment againſt us Chriſtians now a-days:) and as for their acting this upon good Principles, I can hardly imagine, that thoſe who had ſuch noble and worthy Thoughts of God, and of their own Souls, and who plac'd their Happineſs in Purity and Uprightneſs, were ſo much wanting in that Ingredient alſo of Virtue, <hi>viz.</hi> The acting it upon good Principles, as ſome do think. They ſeem to me only to have wanted the Knowledge and Belief of ſome more and better Principles which we do enjoy, to render their Virtue compleat in that reſpect alſo. But that the beſt of our Performances are ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, that it was thought requiſite in the Divine Wiſdom, that the Son of God ſhould become a Sacrifice to expiate their Guilt, and a Mediator with his Father to obtain their Acceptance, is what the proud Hearts of natural Men never thought of, and no Religion but the Chriſtian ever taught: But on the contrary, when they had done well, they did proudly over-value it, and did arrogantly challenge the Reward, not as of Grace, but of Debt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Dependance upon Chriſt neceſſary to take down an arrogant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of our own Righteouſneſs a Temper of Mind most diſpleaſing to God.</note>And therefore to take down this proud and arrogant Preſumption in us, ſo natural to Man, and ſo diſhonourable to God, together with his Deſign of making us Holy, it was withal God's Intent by ſuch a Diſpenſation of his Mercies, as is given us in the Goſpel, to create in us ſuch a Reliance and Dependance upon Chriſt for Salvation, as to expect it, not on the account of our own holy Performance, but in the Vertue of his Mediation with the Father for us; for ſo it is written 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.29, 30, 31. <hi>That to the end that no fleſh may glory in God's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, Jeſus Chriſt is by him made to us Wiſdom, and Righteouſneſs, and Sanctification, and Redemption, that ſo he that glorieth, might glory in the Lord.</hi> And indeed it does exceedingly tend <hi>to the praiſe and glory of his Grace, that he hath made us accepted in the Beloved,</hi> as it is ſaid in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:151517:78"/> 
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. This does eminently ſet forth the exceeding Luſtre of his Mercy towards us in the Goſpel, that our imperfect, if ſincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, ſhall be accepted through the Mediation of Chriſt. It does utterly exclude Boaſting, and all occaſions of proud Reflections on our Parts, as if ſo mean an Obedience as ours, could deſerve ſuch infinite Rewards, as are made over to us in the Goſpel; a Temper of Mind, which as it is very apt to get Entertainment in our Souls, ſo ought of all things to be ſuppreſt within us. And thus I have given you a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger account of the Nature of the Chriſtian Religion, than otherwiſe I ſhould have done, that I might clear the way towards coming to the Knowledge of thoſe <hi>Fundamental Principles</hi> thereof; which I told you are the proper Matter of a Chriſtian Catechiſm.</p>
                  <p>And now anſwerably hereunto,<note place="margin">The Nature of fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</note> the fundamental Principles of our Religion muſt be ſuch Doctrines, as being well underſtood, and throughly believ'd, do moſt powerfully and forcibly perſwade and move Men to be thus Religious; as to tend to deſtroy the Power of Sin, to mortify our Luſts, and all wicked Inclinations within us, to render us pious and devout towards God, juſt and charitable and peaceable Neighbours, and ſober, chaſt and orderly Livers in this World: And which ſhall withal create in us ſuch an humble Opinion of our own Unworthineſs, that when we have done all that we can to deny our ſelves, and have proceeded never ſo far in our Zeal to good Works, we ſhall nevertheleſs, confeſſing that we are but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Servants, depend wholly on Chriſt's Merits and Mediation, and in the Virtue of his Satisfaction and Interceſſion alone, expect Salvation.</p>
                  <p>And now ſuch is the Doctrine of the Covenant of Grace,<note place="margin">An Enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Principles.</note> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that part of it, the Vow in Baptiſm, wherein all do ſolemnly promiſe and vow Repentance, Faith and Obedience; engaging to renounce the World, the Fleſh and the Devil.

                  <p>And ſuch fundamental Principles alſo in a prime Sence are the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of all the Articles of our Chriſtian Faith, as the Belief of God,<note place="margin">

The Belief that he gives his Spirit to ſanctify us, and that he will hereafter come in Perſon to Judge us. In a word, The Belief of all the Articles of our Chriſtian Faith.

                        <hi>IV.</hi> The Doctrine of Prayer, and of the Sacraments.</note>And if to theſe we add the Doctrine of Prayer, and of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are the neceſſary Means, and appointed us by God, of our procuring and conveying unto us his Aſſiſtance, to enable us to mortify and forſake our Sins, and to become Holy: I do not know any other Principles that are Fundamentally neceſſary, either to the promoting of a good Life here, or an happy One hereafter; at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſo far, as to be the Matter of Catechetical Inſtruction, and the Buſineſs of a Catechiſt to inform you of them.</p>
                  <p>And indeed as theſe Doctrines are every One of them neceſſary to be Known, Believ'd, and Practic'd by every Chriſtian, that may have the Means of Knowing them, and may be taught them, being no other than the Covenant of Grace it ſelf, or thoſe particular Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles contain'd in it, and which are expreſly Enjoyn'd upon us by the Word of God to be Believ'd and Practic'd by us; ſo our Church does account them the only Fundamental and Neceſſary Principles that are to be the Matter of a Chriſtian Catechiſm. There are, it muſt be confeſt, many other uſeful Truths contain'd in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and thoſe, who having firſt laid the Foundation in theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mention'd, would go on to Perfection, ſhould endeavour, by Reading the Bible and other good Books, and by Attending to the Preaching of the Word,<note place="margin">A Catechiſm ought not to be crouded w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> any thing more, than what is pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to a good life here, and Happineſs hereafter.</note> to gain the Knowledge of them: But a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm ought not to be crouded with any thing more than what is purely Fundamental to a Good Life here, and Happineſs hereafter. And if other Churches have fill'd their Catechiſms, either with many Unſcriptural Tenets, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has hers, or with any doubtful and nice Doctrines concerning God's Election and Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as many others have done theirs, they have no reaſon to brag of their Abundance. It is the Glory of our Church that ſhe Impoſes no other Doctrine, as neceſſary to be Learnt by her Children, than thoſe already mention'd, which are plainly declar'd in Scripture to be Fundamental and Neceſſary Principles, whereon we may ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly build a Good Life, and the certain Hopes of eternal Happineſs; and which are ſo firm a Rock, that the Religion and Hopes of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs founded upon it, will not eaſily be deſtroy'd by the moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and boiſtrous Temptations that the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, ſhall Aſſault it withal, thereby to Ruine it.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I Adventured in as few Words, as the Difficulty of the Argument would give me leave, to ſhew you the Nature of <hi>Fundamental Principles,</hi> and to declare to you what Doctrines are to be accounted ſuch, ſo far at leaſt, as they are the Matter of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techetical Inſtruction, and the Buſineſs of a Catechiſt to inform you of them.</p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:151517:79"/>
                  <p>I have done this Point when I have told you,<note place="margin">A Catechiſm is a General Inſtruction in the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</note> That a Catechiſm is <hi>A General Inſtruction only, in the fundamental Principles of Chriſtianity.</hi> As a Catechiſm ought not to be crouded with any thing more than what is purely Fundamental to a Good Life here, and Happineſs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; ſo even thoſe Fundamental Truths it ought to deliver in as ſhort and comprehenſive a manner as poſſible; for a Catechiſm is an Inſtruction that muſt be fitted to all, even the weakeſt Capacities, and therefore it ought to be ſuch a Form of ſound Words, as all can retain: And the more explicite and enlarged Knowledge of theſe things is to be ſought for in the Expoſitions and Comments that are given of them in Catechetical Diſcourſes, of which Nature I deſign, by God's Grace, to Preſent you with ſome, until I have gone through your Catechiſm.</p>
                  <p>In a word, and to conclude this Firſt Point:<note place="margin">Such were the Ancient, and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſms.</note> Such a General In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in the Fundamental and moſt Neceſſary Points of Religion, as we have given you an Account of, was the Matter of which the ancient Catechiſms did moſtly conſiſt, even in the time of the Apoſtles, and ſuch is the Catechiſm you are now Learning.</p>
                  <p>As to the ancient Catechizing in the Apoſtles times, as it is plain from the Example of <hi>Theophilus,</hi> Luk. 1.4. that the New Converts receiv'd their firſt Notions of Religion by Catechizing, as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerv'd: So <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. we read of a <hi>Form of Doctrine that was delivered to them,</hi> which the beſt Interpreters ſuppoſe to have been a Summary of Chriſtian Doctrine, or Body of Catechetical Points: And what thoſe Points were, which they firſt taught them, we have expreſly laid down <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. from whence it appears, that thoſe <hi>Firſt Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt</hi> were, for the moſt part, the very ſame I have now mention'd, <hi>viz.</hi> The Doctrines of Repentance, Faith, and of the Sacraments: They are alſo called there the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> which being laid, the Apoſtle tells them, he will go on to perfect them by other Teaching.</p>
                  <p>And ſuch a General Inſtruction alſo is the Catechiſm you are now Learning, and which I am at preſent about to Expound to you.<note place="margin">And ſuch is our Church-Catechiſm.</note> You have therein indeed given you a Summary Doctrine of all the Fundamental and neceſſary Articles of Chriſtianity. And the Seed of theſe Catechetical Points, if they be but receiv'd into well-diſpos'd Hearts, will in time, by God's Grace, produce a plentiful Crop of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Knowledge: So that I may very ſafely affirm it, That whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of you ſhall learn to underſtand throughly his Church-Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, ſhall be ſufficiently inſtructed to Salvation; and whoſoever ſhall live according to thoſe Principles therein taught, need no more to render him a good Chriſtian in this World, and an happy Saint in the World to come.</p>
                  <p>And ſo much for the Firſt Point in my Deſcription of a Catechiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> The Matter of which a Catechiſm is to conſiſt; that it is a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inſtruction in the Fundamental and neceſſary Principles of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The next, are the Perſons that are to be Catechized,<note place="margin">The Perſons that are to be Catechized, are every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> and in the Definition I have given of a Catechiſm, it is ſaid to be <hi>An In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction neceſſary to be Learnt of every Perſon.</hi> It is very certain that whoever would be skilful in any Art or Science whatſoever, he muſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:151517:80"/> endeavour firſt to underſtand the Principles of it. This is every day's Experience: He that would be a good Grammarian, or Latin Scholar muſt firſt learn to underſtand his Grammar Rules; you know it is impoſſible to read at all before you know your Letters, or to read well till you can ſpell or diſtinguiſh between the Syllables. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, He that would be a knowing, and withal a ſtable Chriſtian (as it is every Body's infinite Concern to be both) he muſt make it his Care and Buſineſs to be come well inſtructed in the Principles (thoſe which we call the fundamental Points) of the Chriſtian Doctrine: That the way to Perfection in the Chriſtian, as well as other Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, is to begin with the Principles of it, appears from that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Leaving the principles of the doctrine of Chriſt, let us go on to perfection.</hi> Hereby you ſee, that his Method in Teaching was firſt to begin with grounding in the Principles of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and then to proceed to higher things; and the ſame Method the Apoſtle took in teaching of Religion, the ſame muſt the Diſciples be ſuppoſed to do in learning of it. If the Apoſtle began with teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Principles, the Diſciples muſt begin with the learning of them. And the Wiſdom of laying firſt a Foundation of good Principles, and building our Religion upon them, and the Folly on the other ſide of not laying a good Foundation of ſuch, is ſufficiently repreſented in that Parable of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.24. The wiſe Man, he there tells us, <hi>Built his Houſe upon a Rock,</hi> or a Foundation of good Principles, <hi>and when the rain deſcended, and floods came, and winds blew and beat upon that houſe, it fell not, for it was founded upon a Rock. But the fooliſh man he built his houſe upon the Sand,</hi> upon none at all, or a very ſorry Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; and mark the Fate of that Man's Religion, when the <hi>floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that Houſe, it ſell, and great was the fall of it.</hi> A Perſon well grounded in the Principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſhall be able to bear the Shock of the fierceſt Temptations, but a Perſon of no Principles ſhall not be able to withſtand the leaſt. This Parable does excellently well ſet forth the Neceſſity of being well grounded in Religious Principles,<note place="margin">The neceſſity of every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons being well grounded in Religious Principles by Catechetical Inſtruction.</note> which can only be done, I have ſhewed you, by learning of the Catechiſm.</p>
                  <p>I do not ſay that Perſons ſhould be always in their Catechiſm; but when they have laid the Foundation there, ſo that they cannot only ſay, but underſtand it, by having had it explain'd to them; my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice then with the Apoſtle to the <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. is, That <hi>leaving the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the doctrine of Chriſt, they proceed to perfection,</hi> and farther to improve their Knowledge in Divine Things: But this I ſay, that every Chriſtian muſt lay the Foundation of his Religion here; and if this has not been yet done, it is better late than never.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The Contempt hereof is the effect of Pride and the cauſe of Ignorance.</note>Thoſe who think themſelves too Wiſe already, or too Good to ſubmit themſelves to ſo mean an Inſtruction, as they ignorantly eſteem Catechizing to be, I can never promiſe my ſelf much Good from them.

                  <p>The Matter without doubt of Catechetical Doctrines is fit to be apply'd to Perſons of any Age, that are as yet but Beginners in the School of Chriſt: And therefore, as we find in Church-Hiſtory, not only the moſt Learned of the Primitive Fathers, as <hi>Pantaenus, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens, Origen,</hi> did open Schools of Catechizing, by which means ſeveral Countries within few Years receiv'd the Goſpel:<note place="margin">It is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Perſons of any Age or Quality to lay the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techetical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</note> So we alſo find from the ſame Hiſtories, that Perſons of all Ages, and of all Qualities, did ſubmit themſelves to be Inſtructed this way, till ſuch time as they were perfected in the Myſteries of Religion. We read of Emperours, that have ſtood amongſt the Catechumens, or Perſons Catechized, and of ſome who have been Advanc'd from being Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumens to be Biſhops, the Higheſt Degree in the Church, as the other in the State. Nor is it deſign'd by our Church for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Children only: But a <hi>Catechiſm is an Inſtruction neceſſary to be learnt of every Perſon,</hi> indifferently, <hi>before he be brought to be Confirmed by the Biſhop,</hi> as appears by the Title and Deſcription of your Catechiſm, on which Words I am now Diſcourſing, which brings me to ſpeak to what End Catechizing is deſign'd.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The End of Catechizing to prepare for Confirmation.</note> 
                     <hi>And it is deſign'd to prepare you to be Confirmed by the Biſhop.</hi> Confirmation is an open Profeſſion from the Mouth of One formerly Baptized, and now come to Years of Diſcretion, made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Biſhop and the Congregation of Chriſt's Church, of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to, and Ratifying that Vow made in Baptiſm by his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers and Godmothers in his behalf, with a ſolemn Promiſe,<note place="margin">Confirmation, What?</note> that he will endeavour in his own Perſon, according as was Engag'd for him, to Renounce the World, the Fleſh and the Devil, to Believe in God, and to Obey him. This on the part of the Perſon Confirm'd: And then on the Biſhop's part, It conſiſts in his ſolemn Prayers to God, to enable the Party, by the Grace of his Holy Spirit, to do the ſame; and in his Epiſcopal and Fatherly Benediction, or Bleſſing of him, together with his Laying on of Hands, after the Example of the Holy Apoſtles, to certify him of God's Favour and gracious Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards him. This is the Doctrine of Laying on of Hands, or Confirmation, entire and unmaim'd in either of its eſſential Parts,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:151517:81"/> according as it is deliver'd in our Church, and is order'd to be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, both by thoſe who come to this Holy Inſtitution, and by thoſe who are Intruſted with the Adminiſtration of it: And a Rite it is both greatly Neceſſary, and of ſingular Benefit in the Church of Chriſt.</p>

This has in all Diſpenſations, before the Law, under the Law, and under the Goſpel, been Uſed both by Natural Parents, and by the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Fathers of the Church, as a Solemn way of their Bleſſing. Thus <hi>Jacob Bleſſed his Sons, Laying his Hands upon their Heads,</hi> Gen. 48.17. So <hi>Aaron lifted up his Hands towards the People, and Bleſſed them,</hi> Lev. 9.22.

For why? In your Confirmation you do Voluntarily and of Choice take upon you that Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, which before, in your Minority, was done by others in your behalf. And it is neceſſary before you take upon your ſelves ſo great and weighty a Buſineſs, as the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Conditions of the Covenant of Grace, that you be firſt Inſtructed, ſo as to underſtand them well, both what thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Repentance, Faith and Obedience are; and what mighty Bleſſings God vouchſafes to make over to you in the ſame Covenant that ſhould be an Encouragement, and reaſonable Conſideration to you, to undertake ſo great a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d weighty a Charge. Juſt as in the caſe of a Perſon under Age, who, by reaſon of his Minority, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uncapable of himſelf to Enter into any Covenants, his Truſtees may do it for him: But when he is come to Age, and muſt Seal to, and Confirm ſuch Covenants himſelf, it it requiſite he have them Read to him, and be made to underſtand what Advantages accrue to him thereby, before he Confirm them in his own Perſon.</p>
                  <p>But why not this Inſtruction, rather before Baptiſm than Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation? It is in Baptiſm that we Enter into Covenant with God, and Catechetical Inſtruction ſhould therefore properly go before that, you'll ſay.</p>
                  <p>And in the beginning of Chriſtianity indeed, when the Parties Baptized were, for the moſt part, Perſons grown up to Years of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:151517:82"/> who Abandoning their Heatheniſh, or Jewiſh Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Practices, gave themſelves up to be Chriſt's Diſciples, it was required that ſuch, even before they were Baptized, ſhould be firſt Catechized in the Principles of Chriſtianity, and be made to underſtand the Conditions of that Covenant, which by their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm they were to Enter into with God. And ſo it is ſtill requiſite, that all New Converts from Paganiſm, or Judaiſm, or Mahometiſm, or any other contrary Religion, ſhould be likewiſe firſt Inſtructed before they be Admitted to Baptiſm, becauſe ſuch being as well to Unlearn, as it were, their former falſe Religion, as to Learn the true Chriſtian Profeſſion; they ought therefore to Underſtand both, e're they can well Renounce that, or before they can Reaſonably put on, or Embrace this. But as to you, who are the Children of Chriſtian Parents, your Caſe is quite different, for having no falſe Religion to Unlearn and Renounce, and having a kind of Right of Inheritance, by Virtue of your Chriſtian Parentage, to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd, even in your Infancy, into the Profeſſion of the True; It is therefore ſufficient that you be Inſtructed, after your Baptiſm, in the Nature and Tenour of the Baptiſmal Covenant, provided that when ſo Inſtructed, you afterwards appear Solemnly to Confirm it before Chriſt's Ambaſſadour, the Biſhop.</p>
                  <p>But then it is highly neceſſary you ſhould be ſo Catechiz'd and Inſtructed before you Perſonally undertake a Matter of ſo great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, that ſo when you come to make a ſolemn and Publick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſuch an Undertaking, you may do it in a way and manner, that becomes reaſonable and wiſe Perſons to do ſo great a thing in, who always know and conſider the Weight and Conſequence of Matters of Moment, e're they will Solemnly make a Profeſſion of them, or Undertake them. So neceſſary is Catechizing in order to the Renewing and Ratifying in Confirmation, that Covenant and Vow which was made in Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>Nor Secondly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> To the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by the Epiſcopal Benediction, Prayers, and Laying on of Hands.</note> Is it leſs neceſſary to your receiving Benefit by the Prayers, the Bleſſing, and by the Laying on of Hands of the Biſhop in Confirmation. As Beneficial as theſe really are to all thoſe, who ſhall come duly Prepared, yet it is certain, that without ſome neceſſary Qualifications in ſuch as come to be Confirm'd (amongſt which, to underſtand the Nature, Terms and Conditions of the Covenant of Grace, and ſeriouſly to Intend to Perform the ſame, are the firſt and chief) none will be much the better for the Biſhop's Prayers, Benediction, or Impoſition of Hands. Theſe may be a Means indeed of obtaining the Graces of the Holy Spirit, to Enable thoſe, that underſtand their Baptiſmal Vows and Covenant with God, to perform ſuch their Engagements, but they are utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to have any Operation upon thoſe, who underſtand not what a Covenant of Grace does mean. And therefore Catechizing, which is the only proper Means to give you ſuch an Underſtanding, muſt needs be exceedingly neceſſary to your being Benefited alſo by what the Biſhop ſhall perform in your Confirmation.</p>
                  <p>And ſo much for the Nature, Neceſſity and End of Catechizing, ſo far as the Title of your Catechiſm does give us occaſion to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of it. And if we conſider it ſo far only, you have a great deal of reaſon to value Catechizing, as a moſt neceſſary and uſeful
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:151517:83"/> Kind of Inſtruction, ſo as to need no great Invitation to it. The Points you ſee therein taught, are the moſt ſubſtantial and weighty Truths of Religion. The Perſons to be ſo inſtructed, are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently any Perſons of whatever Age, Sex, or Quality, till they come to a competent Underſtanding of thoſe moſt neceſſary Points, as has been Practiced in the Apoſtle's Times, and the Primitive Church. And the end thereof you ſee, is no leſs than to render you capable to Confirm that Covenant with God, wherein are contain'd the higheſt and moſt valuable Priviledges in the World, and which coſt the moſt ineſtimable Price to purchaſe them for us, even the Blood of h riſt, and which except you ſhall ſecure your ſelves an Intereſt in, you are deſperate and undone Perſons.</p>
                  <p>And now each of theſe Conſiderations are Reaſons ſufficient to bring you to be Catechized, and to make you value it, as a great Happineſs you may be ſo inſtructed to your Soul's health. But that nothing may be left unſaid, to raiſe in your Minds a due Eſteem of Catechizing, and to perſwade you to attend it; I ſhall over and above what the Title of your Catechiſm directly leads me to ſay concerning it, give you to underſtand ſeveral other good uſes to which Catechizing ſerves, as ſo many Arguments to invite you to it.</p>

                     <hi>THE Second Lecture.</hi> A Catechiſm, that is to ſay, An Inſtruction to be Learned of every Perſon, before he be brought to be Confirmed by the Biſhop.</head>
                  <p>LAST Lord's Day taking theſe Words, which are the Title of your Catechiſm for my Text (as I ſhall do the ſeveral Parts of the Catechiſm it ſelf, till I have gone through with it) and by Commenting upon them, I have given you an account of the Nature, and End of Catechizing, and the Perſons to be Catechized.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As to the Nature of a Catechiſm, It is a general Inſtruction I have told you, in the Fundamental Principles of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Secondly, As to the proper Perſons to be Catechized, I have ſhewed you, that it belongs to all new Beginners in the School of Chriſt to be ſo Inſtructed; and indeed that every individual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, of what Age, or Quality ſoever, ought to lay the Foundation of his Chriſtian Knowledge in Catechetical Inſtruction. And laſtly, The End thereof, I have ſhewed you, is this, That you may be duly fitted and prepared for Confirmation, both to Renew your Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal Vow before the Biſhop, and may be qualify'd to receive Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by the Biſhop's Prayers, Benediction, and by his Laying on of Hands upon you.</p>
                  <p>Well, but there are ſeveral other good Ends and Purpoſes to which Catechizing ſerves, and becauſe the Knowing of them may increaſe your Eſteem thereof, and cauſe you the better to attend it, I will beſtow One other Diſcourſe in ſhewing you what they are, before I proceed to Expound the Catechiſm it ſelf. And</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As for Confirmation,<note place="margin">Catechizing requiſite to prepare Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be worthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants.</note> ſo it is alſo requiſite to fit and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare you that you may be <hi>Worthy Communicants in the Lord's Supper.</hi> Juſt as in Confirmation, ſo in the Lord's Supper, we do ſolemnly, tho' not ſo publickly Ratify and Renew our Covenant with God; and for the ſame reaſon therefore, that Catechizing is requiſite to prepare you for Confirmation, it muſt be alſo neceſſary to fit you for worthy Communicants, that you may Communicate with Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and as Perſons that underſtand what they do. And alas! To what is it but to their having been never inſtructed in their <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> by Catechizing, that ſo many come ſo Ignorantly, or elſe not at all to the Lord's Supper. I ſay ſo Ignorantly, for as too many of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:151517:84"/> thoſe that do now and then Communicate,<note place="margin">The want thereof the Occaſion of People's Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Sacrament, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,</note> have but a ſlender Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Nature and Conditions of their Covenant; ſo too few do underſtand the Importance of the Bleſſed Sacrament, that <hi>It is the New Covenant in Chriſt's Blood,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.25. that is, That it is the Seal of that Covenant, which was Purchas'd by, and Ratify'd in his Blood: But ſuch as have been throughly Catechized, as they have been made to Underſtand the Terms and Conditions of the Covenant of Grace, both the ineſtimable Priviledges made over to them on God's part, and thoſe very reaſonable Conditions to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd on their own; ſo they have been alſo taught, that One main End of Communicating in the Lord's Supper, is to Ratify, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, and Seal this Covenant of Grace between God and Us. And then thoſe, that have been taught this, cannot come Ignorantly to the Lord's Supper, nor conſequently are in ſuch danger of coming Unworthily,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> Of Receiving <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthily.</note> for Ignorance of the Nature and Conſequence of that Bleſſed Ordinance, is generally as much the cauſe, as any thing, that any do approach Unworthily to it.</p>
                  <p>Nor if the People of our Nation had been ever throughly Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chized,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> Of not Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at all.</note> would ſo many Abſtain, as commonly do, from ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all; for if all Men were throughly inſtructed in the Nature, Terms and Conditions of their Covenant, which it is the Buſineſs of Catechizing to do; as they would then eaſily diſcern, that it is the higheſt and moſt ineſtimable Priviledge in the World, to be took into ſuch a Covenant of Grace, wherein they have God Almighty Engaging himſelf, and putting his Seal to it in the Sacrament, to make good to them the moſt ineſtimable Bleſſings, Pardon, and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, on the moſt reaſonable Conditions, Repentance, Faith, and Goſpel Obedience: So, if they did rightly underſtand this, they would then account it, as it really is, the higheſt Priviledge in the World, to be Confederates with God in ſo advantagious a Covenant, and would think they could never often enough Partake at the Lord's Table, whereby the oft'ner they come, they do more and more ſecure to themſelves thoſe ineſtimable Benefits, made over to us by the Covenant of Grace; and Engage, as themſelves more cloſely to God, ſo God himſelf more inviolably (as it were) to make good thoſe Bleſſings to them. No ſurely, if all Chriſtians had been but Catechized in thoſe Points, both what a mighty Priviledge it is to be in Covenant with God, and that Receiving of the Sacrament is the Rite of God's own Appointment, of Confirming to our ſelves all the Benefits of this Covenant, we ſhould then have our People Daily crouding to the Lord's Table, which they do now ſo profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turn their Backs upon; we ſhould not then need ſo much to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite and entreat Perſons to come, but they would of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord Embrace all Opportunities of more and more Enſuring to themſelves theſe moſt invaluable Benefits, by often coming.</p>
                  <p>In a word, A Man is no more fit to partake of the Lord's Supper, that does not well underſtand the Nature and Terms of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which he does therein Ratify and Seal with God; than he is fit to Seal to Covenants and Leaſes, whoſe Conditions and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he never had ſo much as Read over to him, nor does he know them. But Catechizing is the appointed and moſt proper Means of gaining a competent Meaſure of Underſtanding, in the Nature and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:151517:84"/> Terms of the Covenant of Grace: Without having been Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chized, therefore a Man cannot be well expected to partake worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Lord's Supper.</p>
                  <p>And this is the Second Uſe to which Catechizing does therefore ſerve, to prepare you, that you may be ſit and worthy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants at the Lord's Table.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>III.</hi> Catechizing is Requiſite to Perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Edifyed by Preaching.</note> Catechizing is very uſeful to render you <hi>Capable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Edification by the Preaching of the Word, and to your Profiting by Sermons.</hi> That is certainly the true and only edifying Preaching, which does moſt plainly lay open before you, the Meaning, the Reaſons, and the Importance of any Article of your Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you may beſt know God, and the Neceſſity of ſerving him; and which does moſt clearly Explain to you the Nature and true Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of your Chriſtian Duties, whereby you may know what it is you have to do, and may be freed from all cauſleſs Doubts and Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples about the way of your Happineſs: And laſtly, which does give you the moſt convincing Arguments and Reaſons, to move and ſtir you up faithfully to diſcharge your manifold Obligations to God, your Neighbour, and your ſelves. Such as this is truly Edifying Preaching, becauſe this will, if you do duly attend to it, build you up perfect Chriſtians in the Knowledge and Practice of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>And now One that has been Catechized, ſo as to have a general Underſtanding in the <hi>Nature of his Covenant;</hi> when ſuch a One hears a Sermon upon any particular Point of that Covenant, whereby he has more fully explain'd to him the Nature and Attributes of God, and his Saviour's Mediation, and of his own Duty, than formerly in Catechizing could be done; and when he hears any good Reaſons and Motives given, whereby he ſhould ſeriouſly apply himſelf to live ſo and ſo, as becomes the Servant of ſuch a God, and ſuch a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and one that profeſſes to pay him ſuch Obedience: When a Catechized, Underſtanding Perſon hears ſuch Preaching is this, he finds his Underſtanding more enlightned with Heavenly Truths, and his Will and Affections more bent upon doing as he has been In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed; and ſo (as in all reaſon he ought) he accounts ſuch a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon truly Edifying, and himſelf Edify'd thereby.</p>
                  <p>But the Ignorant and Uncatechized part of the World, when they hear a Sermon (for want of Diſcretion to judge of its real Worth) ſuch look only at ſome ſuch trifling Conſideration, as the Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence and Noiſe of the Speaker; and if there be but enough of that (as generally there is the greateſt Shew, where there is the leaſt of Subſtance) tho' they are made to know no more than they did before of the Importance of any Article of their Faith, or of the Nature and Extent of any Duty of Religion, they are however ſtunn'd into Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of they know not what, utterly diſ-regarding the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing and really edifying Preaching, to the very great Prejudice of their Souls, and the utter hinderance of their Improvement by our Miniſtry, in all uſeful and ſubſtantial Knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it is a mighty Help to the gaining Underſtanding in any Science whatſoever, eſpecially the Chriſtian Religion, to have a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral View given one of the whole (which it is the Buſineſs of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techizing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:151517:85"/> to do) and to ſee how one Point depends upon another, and do all ſweetly agree together. For not to mention other Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, by this a Man ſhall be able to judge the better of the Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Weight of any Sermon, or Religious Diſcourſe on any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Point, as whether it does throughly Explain it, or does not take in what does more properly belong to ſome other Matter. And by this a Man ſhall be able alſo to judge whether the Preacher <hi>Builds upon the Foundation, Gold, Silver, precious Stone, or Wood, Hay and Stubble;</hi> and ſhall be able to diſtinguiſh between, and ſeparate the Refuſe and Droſs of a Sermon and Diſcourſe from the weighty and ſubſtantial Parts of it. A Skill, which as it is of vaſt Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, ſo it is but little underſtood by the Generality of People, for want of having been well Catechized and Inſtructed in the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of Chriſtian Religion.</p>

                        <hi>IV.</hi> Catechizing neceſſary to prevent being ſeduced into dangerous Errors.</note>Fourthly, Catechizing is alſo requiſite to ſecure you from being at any time miſ-lead into dangerous Hereſies and Errors, by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and Diſcourſes of Men, <hi>Crafty to deceive,</hi> to the infinite Peril of your immortal Souls. <hi>There muſt be Hereſies,</hi> the Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.19. <hi>That they which are approved may be made manifeſt.</hi> For God does permit them for our Tryal, whether we will ſtand ſtedfaſt to the Truth. And our Saviour bids us <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.45. <hi>Take heed that no man deceive us, for many ſhall come in my Name,</hi> ſays he, that is, will pretend to be Miniſters of Chriſt, <hi>and ſhall deceive many. They will come with all deceiveableneſs,</hi> the Apoſtle tells us, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.10. with ſo much Artifice and Cunning, that, <hi>if it were poſſible, they ſhall deceive the very Elect,</hi> Mat. 24.24. particularly of this ſort are they, St. <hi>Paul</hi> warns us, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Which creep into houſes, and lead captive ſilly women laden with Sins, led away with divers Luſts, ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the Truth.</hi> A Character, than which nothing can more exactly agree to the Seducers of our Times, and the Perſons, whom they do uſually Practice upon to draw aſide, which are for the moſt part Ignorant Women, and the Effect it has upon their Diſciples and Followers, which is to make them great Talkers and Pretenders to extraordinary Knowledge, but in reality not one Jott wiſer in the grand Points of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                  <p>And now, if any of theſe cunning Deceivers ſhall come to any of you, and endeavour to Pervert you, how is it poſſible you ſhould eſcape their Wiles, except you ſhall be well Principled, ſo as through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to underſtand the Foundation Articles of your Religion: But <hi>Holding faſt that form of ſound words,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.13.

Thoſe that agree with this Analogy of Faith, you may be certain are ſound, what do contradict them, you may be ſure are falſe Doctrines. <q>Catechizing is an excellent Means, ſays Mr. <hi>Gouge,</hi> to keep Perſons from the Errors and the Hereſies of the Times: For Perſons well Catechized and Inſtructed in the Principles of Religion, are in a great meaſure Antidoted againſt the Poiſon of ſeducing Doctrines.

Let them be inſtructed how wonderfully Kind the Son of God was to them, as to come down himſelf from Heaven, to call them forth out of the wicked World (wholly given up to the Service of the Devil) to ſerve their God and Maker. Let them be taught betimes, as much as they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to underſtand of this, and of their Duty to God and Man, and what a ſolemn Vow, Promiſe and Profeſſion they have made in their Baptiſm, not willingly to offend ſo good and gracious a Saviour, but to ſerve and honour him for ever: Let but theſe Notions take the firſt Poſſeſſion of your Minds, and it will be hardly poſſible for any Temptation to prevail over you, and to draw you into Sin; you will then Bluſh to hear the lewd and fooliſh Talk of the Godleſs Crew of hardned Sinners, you will then Tremble at their bold Oaths; and you will be out of Countenance to be ſo much as Seen in the Company of Drunkards. If they ſhall endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to joyn with them in their lewd Courſes, you will have That within you will quickly anſwer, I cannot, I dare not do ſo ill a thing: I cannot be guilty of ſo great a Piece of Ingratitude, as to offend ſo good a God, and gracious a Saviour as mine: I dare not be guilty of ſo high an Injuſtice, as to violate my Covenant, Vow and Promiſe to him, for then he will eternally Puniſh me: <hi>Away all ye workers of Iniquity, for I will keep the Commandments of my God.</hi>

Vanity, Youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Luſts, and their wicked Companions hurry them into ſuch bold Villanies, as make us admire the Patience of God, that forbears ſtriking them quick into Hell, but on they go to provoke him to the utmoſt; and how ſhould it be otherwiſe, ſince they have no Notion
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:151517:86"/> of the difference between Good and Evil: Nor any Principle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, that ſhould in the leaſt check them in the Purſuit of that which is Evil, and ſtir them up to that which is Good.</p>
                  <p>True it is, it may too often happen, that One that has laid up in ſtore a good Foundation of Religious Principles, may be tempted, and much ſtaggered in his Conſtancy, and perhaps be overtaken in a Fault, ſo as wilfully to do an ill Thing. But then obſerve the force of Religious Principles: Such a One will ſoon bethink himſelf what he has done, his Conſcience will quickly ſmite him, and he will be immediately brought to Repentance (through the Power of good Principles) and his Fall will but make him more careful of his ways hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Nay, It may ſometimes happen, that a very towardly Youth (notwithſtanding all the care of his Parents and Chriſt's Miniſters to bring him up in the <hi>Nurture and Admonition of the Lord</hi>) when got too ſoon from under the Eye of his Parents and wiſe Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, and falling into lewd Company (with which this Age does too much abound) may at firſt be a little Laught out of Countenance by them, (as is their wont) for being too Preciſe, Reſerv'd, and Melancholly; and after that be drawn by degrees into one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance after another with them in their Ungodly Revels: Nay, and at length be ſo drencht in Sin, as to deface the whole Image of God, that was wrought upon his Soul, ſo as to be even paſt all hopes of Recovery. This is very rare, but yet however too often, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is.</p>

                        <hi>II.</hi> To Recover out of it when fal'n therein.</note>But even in this caſe, Secondly, The Power of thoſe good Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that were early Sown, ſhall be wonderfully ſeen to the Glory of God, and the Praiſe of good Education. Let Diſeaſes, Diſtreſſes, Poverty, or any ſore Affliction befal a lewd and ſorry Liver (as generally, ſooner or later it does) either as the Fruit of their Sin, or as a Chaſtiſement from God to reclaim them. If the Perſon afflicted has been One that was never Inſtructed in the fear of God, he is never the better, nor ſhall you hear ſo much as a good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion from him, nor any the leaſt Signs of Amendment; for why? He knows not what he is to do, nor where he is to begin, nor does he diſtinctly know any good Reaſon wherefore he ought to Amend; for Thanks to the Piety of his good Parents, he never had any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Good inſtill'd into him; and therefore as all his Life-time he Liv'd like an Atheiſt, ſo he now doe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Die like a Beaſt: He was ignorantly brought up, and he Dies ignorant and wicked both.</p>
                  <p>But if it ſhall happen, that One who had receiv'd the Seed of good Principles within him, be overtaken with ſome ſore Affliction, and God be ſo gracious to him, as not to cut him off quickly in the midſt of his Sins, but affords him a leiſurely Chaſtiſement; ſuch a One ſhall begin to be ſerious and to bethink himſelf. He will recal to Mind what he once knew of God, and of his Duty to him. Thoſe good Principles that have long lain Buried under a Load of Sin, will begin to ſtir within him. He will water them ſufficiently with Tears of Repentance, and they will begin to work and revive within. And when he is once come to himſelf, ſo as to think ſeriouſly of Matters, with the Prodigal Son he will ſoon reſolve to <hi>Ariſe and go to his Father, and to ſay unto him, Father I have ſinned againſt Heaven,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:151517:86"/> and before Thee; and am no more worthy to be call'd thy Son, make me as One of thy hired Servants,</hi> Luk. 15.18, 19. The Seed of good and religious Principles ſown in your Hearts by Catechetical Inſtruction, may well be compared to Seed, ſown in the Ground by the Hand of the Husbandman. The Husbandman's Seed may lie Buried in the Earth under many Clods, ſo as to be in danger never to recover, but if the Rains ſhall deſcend from Heaven, ſo as to melt and diſſolve that burden of Earth, with which the Seed was overlaid, it will then begin to work and revive, if it was good Seed, and may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bring forth a very fruitful Crop. So here, if you do but take care to have the Seed of good Principles ſown in your Hearts, and ſhould ye afterwards almoſt extinguiſh all good Motions within you, by laying on a continued Weight of Guilt and Sin; and ſhould God in Mercy hereafter, not pour down the Fury of his Wrath, ſo as immediately to Deſtroy you, but Rain down upon you the gentle Showers of Fatherly Chaſtiſements, ſo as to melt you into Tears, and bring you into a conſidering Temper; the good Principles that lay long Buried, may poſſibly begin to ſtir, and to work in you a Repentance fruitful in good Works.</p>
                  <p>Nay, Such is the Force of good Principles, that even a ſerious Sermon, or but the Diſcourſe of a good Miniſter (eſpecially of him, who firſt ſowed them by his Inſtructions) ſhall ſtir them up, and put them a working, to the Converſion and Reformation of a Sinner.</p>
                  <p>In a word: Such is the Effect of good Principles, that by the Grace of God, they are the likelieſt way to preſerve you in Innocency, and to prevent your falling into any deadly Sin, and then you will be in a happy Condition; you will then be of the Number of thoſe happy Perſons, of whom our Saviour ſpeaks, that they <hi>need no Repentance, Luk.</hi> 15.7. that is ſuch a ſevere, and ſorrowful, and painful Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as Backſliding Sinners, and all Men of looſe and wicked Lives muſt go through, or be forced to Endure infinitely worſe: Or if you ſhall unhappily fall into any grievous Sin, or a Courſe of Sin, ſuch may be the Force of pious Education, or good Principles, as by God's good Grace and Providence, to recover you out of the Snares of the Devil. Theſe good Principles taught you in your Catechiſm, may not perhaps at preſent be throughly underſtood by you, no more than Children do the uſe of Letters, nor School-boys the uſe of Grammar Rules at firſt, but they will ſtick by you (as One ſaid) and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred when you are more capable of Improving them, inſomuch that it will be uneaſy to you, if you take care to be well Principled in your Minority, to be Wicked and Profane hereafter; or if you ſhould prove ſo (which God forbid) there will yet be ſome hopes of Reclaiming you, becauſe theſe things will ſome time or other revive and awaken your Conſciences.</p>
                  <p>And this is the laſt of thoſe good Uſes and Ends, to which Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm ſerves; <hi>(viz.)</hi> to Inſtil into you ſuch good Principles, as will either prevent your falling into Sin, (which is much the Happier for you) or at leaſt recover you out of it by Repentance; and which I have therefore inſiſted on, that I might perſwade you to have a due Regard to ſo uſeful an Inſtruction, as Catechizing is, and to give a due Attendance to it.</p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:151517:87"/>
                  <p>And thus, as laſt Lord's Day I ſhewed you, that one good End to which Catechizing ſerves, is to prepare you for that neceſſary Work, your Confirmation, that you may Publickly, and with Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as thoſe that know what they do) profeſs before the Biſhop, That you will be Faithful to your Baptiſmal Covenant: So Secondly, I have to Day ſhewed you, That it is for the ſame Reaſon requiſite to prepare you for Receiving of the Bleſſed Sacrament, both by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing you in the Covenant of Grace, which in the Sacrament we Seal, and in the Meaning of the Sacrament it ſelf, that it is the Rite of Sealing it. Thirdly, I have now ſhewed you, that Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing is very uſeful to render you underſtanding Hearers of the Word, when it is Preacht, ſo as you may receive Edification by it, and may be Profited by Sermons. Fourthly, That it is requiſite to ſecure you from being at any time miſ-led into dangerous Hereſies and Errors, by the Sermons and Diſcourſes of Men, crafty to Deceive, to the Peril of your immortal Souls. And Laſtly, I have now largely ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, that it is exceeding Uſeful to preſerve you from falling into any groſs and waſting Sin, and eſpecially any ungodly Courſe of Living; or if any of you ſhall hereafter be Seduced (which God forbid) by evil Company, that the having the Seed of good Principles ſown in the Heart by a timely Catechizing, will be the moſt likely Means to recover you out of the Snares of the Devil.</p>

                     <hi>THE Third Lecture. <hi>What is your Name?</hi>
                     </hi> And the Anſwer is made by the Chriſtian Name.</head>
                  <p>IN Two Diſcourſes, on the Title of your Catechiſm, having given you to underſtand what a Catechiſm means, and ſhewed you alſo the Ends and Uſes of Catechizing; I ſhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by God's Aſſiſtance to Explain the Catechiſm it ſelf, and to give you the Meaning of its ſeveral Parts. And the firſt Thing that offers it ſelf to our Conſideration, is the firſt Queſtion in your Catechiſm, <hi>(viz) What is your Name?</hi> And the Anſwer you are taught to make to it, which is your <hi>Chriſtian Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this Queſtion is not ſo idle and inſignificant, as ſome may imagine, but is ask'd upon very good Reaſons; inſomuch that I do think, they may give me a very fair Occaſion, to diſcourſe to you upon theſe Three Heads:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To ſhew you, that the Reaſon wherefore your Catechiſm begins with Asking you, What is your Chriſtian Name? Is to put you in mind of your Chriſtian Profeſſion, and of that ſtrictneſs of Life, that is anſwerable thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They do give me occaſion to re-mind you, that the bad Lives of ſuch who bear the Name of Chriſtians, do an infinite Prejudice and Diſ-honour to Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>And Thirdly, To exhort you therefore to ſtand upon the Dignity of your Chriſtian Name and Profeſſion, by living ſuch good Lives, as may be an Honour, not a Diſgrace unto it.</p>
                  <p>And theſe Three Heads of Diſcourſe, as they do naturally ariſe from this Queſtion and Anſwer about your Chriſtian Name, ſo I know not any thing can be more properly and ſeaſonably Diſcours'd upon in the Entrance upon your Catechiſm, as tending to warn you before-hand to apply every thing you ſhall hereafter hear, either in the Catechiſm it ſelf, or in the Explication thereof, to the Better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your Lives and Practices. To begin then,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I am to ſhew you, that the Reaſon wherefore your Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm begins with Asking you, What is your Chriſtian Name? Is to put you in mind of your Chriſtian Profeſſion, and of that ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life, that is anſwerable thereunto.</p>
                  <p>It is thought ſufficient to juſtify this Queſtion and Anſwer about your Chriſtian Name (tho' there were no great Matter imply'd in its meaning) that it is the beginning of a Dialogue, it being the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:151517:88"/> uſual manner of Dialogues, or mutual Diſcourſes, managed between ſeveral Perſons, (be the Subject of them never ſo grave and ſerious) not to fall immediately Point-blank upon the main Matter intended, but in ſuch, they uſually uſher in the more material Points, by ſuch familiar Queſtions as this.</p>
                  <p>But not to inſiſt on this, and many other good Reaſons, that might be given; tho' there be great Familiarity and Condeſcenſion in the Queſtion, yet it is not without good Reaſon and Conſideration, that in the Entrance of this Inſtruction in your Chriſtian Religion, you ſhould be firſt ask'd your Chriſtian Name.<note place="margin">The reaſon wherefore the Catechiſm begins with Asking the Catechumen his Chriſtian Name, is to put him in mind of his Chriſtian Profeſſion.</note> And the great Reaſon is, That at the Mention thereof, you might be prompted to call to Mind what Religion and Profeſſion you are of. You had your Chriſtian Names given you, at the ſame time you took upon you the Chriſtian Profeſſion; you are therefore in the firſt Entrance of your Catechiſm (which is an Inſtruction of you in this your Chriſtian Profeſſion) Ask'd, What is your Chriſtian Name? That you might call to Mind that moſt excellent Religion you receiv'd together with it, and under that Name ſolemnly Promiſed and Vowed, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and cleave unto.</p>
                  <p>Your Sir-name you have derived down unto you from your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, and you receiv'd it from your Natural Parents: But your Chriſtian Name you receiv'd immediately from the Mouths of your Spiritual Parents, your Miniſter, and your Godfathers, who as your Proxies, did at they ſame time, they gave you a Chriſtian Name, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for you, that you ſhould live a Chriſtian Life, Holy and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blamable, as becomes thoſe, who bear ſo glorious a Title. You muſt therefore conſider what your Name is, and the Importance of it, that it is Chriſtian, and you muſt take care, that you Live not ſo, as to bring a Scandal upon that Name, in any Sin and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but ſo, as becomes thoſe, who profeſs Chriſtianity, and wear the Name of Chriſtians, <hi>In Holineſs and Righteouſneſs all the Days of your Lives.</hi> And as he, who hath called you, is Holy, ſo be ye Holy in all manner of Converſation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Force there is in a Chriſtian name to make a Man lead a Chriſtian life as under that Name hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Liſted himſelf.</note>And there is indeed the greateſt Force in our very Chriſtian Names, to render us Conformable to the Chriſtian Doctrine, and whereby we may be perſwaded to live Chriſtian-like, otherwiſe the Apoſtle would not have laid ſo much ſtreſs upon our very Name and Profeſſion of Chriſtians, as he does, to perſwade us from that very Reaſon to live Holy and Chriſtian Lives. <hi>Let every one that nameth the Name of Chriſt,</hi> or upon whom the Name of Chriſt is called, <hi>depart from Iniquity,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19. For why? It is ever expected, that thoſe, that profeſs to be guided by the perfecteſt Doctrines, ſhould anſwerably live the moſt perfect Lives. The Heathens did therefore expect,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> A Diſciple of a moſt Holy and excellent Religion.</note> that their Philoſophers, who gave the higheſt Principles and Rules of Morality, ſhould themſelves exceed all others in a vertuous and orderly Courſe of Life; and when they found any of their Philoſophers a Tripping, and living at the rate of other Men of looſer Principles, how ſeverely therefore would they Reflect upon them for it? Now we Chriſtians profeſs our ſelves the Diſciples of a <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> that does infinitely exceed all others in the Powerfulneſs of its Principles and Doctrines, and in the Holineſs and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:151517:88"/> Strictneſs of its Commands. We have given up our Names,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> A Servant of a moſt Holy and juſt God.</note> and Liſted our ſelves to be the Souldiers and Servants, not of a Lewd <hi>Jupiter,</hi> a Wanton <hi>Venus,</hi> a Fiery <hi>Mars,</hi> a Revengeful <hi>Juno,</hi> a Drunken <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and a Thieviſh <hi>Mercury:</hi> Such were the Heathen Gods, and no wonder then, that they who did worſhip them, ſhould alſo imitate them. But we have given up our Names and Liſted our ſelves the Servants of <hi>A God, that hath no pleaſure in Wickedneſs, neither ſhall any Evil dwell with him; in whoſe ſight the Fooliſh ſhall not ſtand, and who hateth all the workers of Iniquity; who will deſtroy all men that ſpeak leaſing</hi> (that are crafty to cheat and deceive) <hi>and will abhor the blood-thirſty and deceitful man,</hi> Pſal. 5.4, 5, 6. Nay, <hi>who will rain upon the Wicked, Snares, Fire and Brimſtone, and an horrible Tempeſt; this ſhall be the portion of their Cup, for the Righteous Lord loveth Righteouſneſs, his Countenance doth behold the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright,</hi> Pſal. 11.6, 7.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>III.</hi> To fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil.</note> Such is the God to whom we have given up our Names to ſerve: And we have Liſted our ſelves in our Baptiſm, under our ſeveral Chriſtian Names, to fight under his Banner againſt the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, ſo as not to be tempted or drawn off to commit any Injuſtice, or Unmercifulneſs, any Intemperance, or Filthineſs, any Act of Ungodlineſs, or Profaneneſs: In a word,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>IV.</hi> Asunder that Name he profeſſes to Believe ſuch Articles as are the moſt powerful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to deny all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> any Sin againſt him. We have engaged our ſelves under our ſeveral Names in the ſtrongeſt Covenants, in hopes of the moſt glorious Rewards, and out fear of the ſoreſt Puniſhments, to be Faithful in our Obedience to him. We have openly Profeſt under our reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Chriſtian Names, firmly to believe ſuch a Set of Articles (thoſe of our Chriſtian Faith) as are every one of them (as ſhall hereafter be made appear) the moſt powerful Motives in the World, to make us <hi>Deny all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and worldly Luſts, and to live ſoberly, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and godly in this preſent evil World.</hi> And under the ſame Chriſtian Names we have all of us profeſt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>V.</hi> To obey the moſt Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Laws.</note> To be governed by ſuch Laws and Commands of Vertue and Goodneſs, of Piety towards God, of Righteouſneſs to our Neighbours, and which lay down ſuch incomparable Rules concerning the Government of our ſelves, as the like are not to be found in any other <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> And Laſtly,<note place="margin">Laſtly, as having under that Name received Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of moſt powerful Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances to do all this.</note> We profeſs to have ſuch Aſſiſtances derived to us from God, by Prayer and Sacraments (thoſe Means of his own Appointment to convey down his Aid and Aſſiſtance to us, to Enable us to do theſe Things) as will make it not extreamly difficult to us, to live very excellent and good Lives.</p>
                  <p>Thus have we Chriſtians under our ſeveral Chriſtian Names (as under Hand and Seal) profeſt our ſelves the Diſciples of a Religion, that does infinitely exceed all others in the Powerfulneſs of its Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Doctrines, and the Holineſs and Strictneſs of its Precepts and Rules: Of a Religion, that can work, if its Dictates be follow'd, the greateſt Miracles in the changing Men's Natures and Tempers from worſe to better; that can turn a ravenous <hi>Wolf</hi> into a harmleſs <hi>Lamb,</hi> a furious <hi>Lion</hi> into a tender <hi>Kid;</hi> that is, the moſt ſavage and violent Diſpoſitions of Cruelty and Pride, into perfect Charity and Meekneſs. And now, if we Chriſtians ſhould be found as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd and Evil Livers, as Unconverted Heathens, as Lewd as Turks, as Griping as Jews, as Impious and Profane as Atheiſts, how ſeverely, and that deſervedly, will the reſt of the Infidel World
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:151517:89"/> upbraid us? What Diſhonour ſhall we thereby do to the true God, and our moſt Holy Religion?</p>
                  <p>Which brings me to the Second Thing propos'd, which was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind you, that the bad Lives of thoſe who bear the Name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, do an infinite Prejudice and Diſhonour to Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The bad lives of Nominal Chriſtians do an infinite Prejudice &amp; Diſhonour to Chriſtianity.</note>And alas! What bitter Reproaches have the Unchriſtian Lives of Chriſtian Profeſſors, put into the Mouths of our Enemies, making them to ſay, That if we Chriſtians, did but Believe our ſelves, thoſe Promiſes in Scripture, of ſuch mighty Rewards to Holy, Honeſt and Good Living, we ſhould ſure our ſelves live better Lives: And when any of our Chriſtians would perſwade them to forſake their own Superſtition and Idolatry, and to Embrace our moſt Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, our unanſwerable Lives have provok'd them to return ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough upon us, Would ye have us to believe the Truth of your Religion, which you do not ſeem to believe your ſelves?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">It hinders the Converſion of Infidels.</note>And alas! This is the main Thing, the very Unſuitable Lives of us Chriſtians, that ſo Prejudices the Infidel Part of the World, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, Turks, and Jews againſt our moſt Holy Religion, and hinders their Converſion. It is the Cruelty, and Covetouſneſs of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Merchants in the <hi>Indies,</hi> that makes the poor <hi>Indians</hi> even Abhor our Religion, and ſcornfully to ſay, That Gold, not <hi>Jehovah,</hi> is our God. Thus <hi>Is the Name of God blaſphemed amongſt the Gentiles through us,</hi> Rom. 2.24. It is the Idolatry of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which makes Turks and Jews (both of them mortal Haters of Idols) to loath and deſpiſe the Chriſtian Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">It puts bitter Reproaches in the mouths of Atheiſts, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when Wickedneſs is commited un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note>But not to Travel ſo far, as the <hi>Indies</hi> or <hi>Turkey,</hi> to find out how much our Living ſo unbecoming our moſt Holy Profeſſion, has ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daliz'd Perſons, ſo as to Abhor it; Obſerve the Men of No Religion amongſt our ſelves, our Atheiſts and Libertines, and what bitter Scoffs and Jeers may we daily hear them caſt forth upon Religion it ſelf, when they ſee ſome, that make great outward Profeſſions there, guilty of ſo much Hypocriſy, Cheating, Cruelty, and Rebellion; making their very Religion, a Cloak for the carrying on the moſt wicked Things, as if the leaſt Religious, the moſt honeſt Man. And now, if there were but the leaſt ſpark of Love and Honour in our Hearts for God and our moſt Holy Religion, this were enough to make us careful to lead innocent and inoffenſive Lives, if it were only that we might not diſhonour God and Religion thereby, and might not bring a Reproach upon our Chriſtian Name. Every Man that deſires the Honour and Reputation of his Calling and Profeſſion whatever it is, will live anſwerable to his Character, and not ſo, as to be a Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to his Place.<note place="margin">Few men will endure their worldly Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be put at naught and Reproacht.</note> And therefore, as we ſeldom ſee a Perſon of ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and mean a Spirit, as to endure with Patience, whatever Art, or Profeſſion he is of, to be ſet at naught and ſpoke againſt; ſo Men are generally, with reſpect to the Credit of their worldly Profeſſions, careful to act with that Decency and Becomingneſs, as ſhall advance, the Reputation thereof. Hence the Lawyer, as he cannot ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily endure (except he be a profligate Perſon) his Profeſſion of the Law, nor the Phyſician his, nor the Tradeſman his, to be run down, Expos'd and made Ridiculous; ſo each of theſe will be, as much as poſſible, for maintaining in their ſeveral Dealings a Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Fairneſs and Honeſty, as that alone which will raiſe and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:151517:89"/> Preſerve an Eſteem for them. And how then comes it about that a Chriſtian can endure to hear his Chriſtian Profeſſion reproach'd and ſcorn'd by reaſon of his ſcandalous Living? Whence is it, but from the greater Zeal Men generally have for the Honour of their worldly Callings and Profeſſions, than for the Honour of their Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Profeſſion and Calling.</p>
                  <p>And now therefore Thirdly, Let me Exhort you,<note place="margin">An Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore to Chriſtians to ſtand upon the Dignity of their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Name and Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> to ſtand upon the Dignity of your Chriſtian Name and Profeſſion, by living ſuch good Lives, as may be an Honour, not a Diſgrace unto it: Let me therefore Admoniſh you from this very Name, wherewith you are Honoured, to render your ſelves wholly conformable to thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Principles and Doctrines to which you have given up your Names to be governed by, and which being taught you in your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm, I ſhall by God's leave, with all the Plainneſs, and in the moſt uſeful manner I can explain unto you.</p>
                  <p>And pray let me Entreat you, my Dear Youth, ſeriouſly and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to hearken to me your Spiritual Father, that ſtudies no leſs the Eternal Intereſt of your Souls, and to make you Heirs of Heaven, than your Natural Parents do your Temporal Intereſt to gather you Riches, and to leave you Eſtates in this World. You have been Ask'd, and you have Anſwer'd to your Chriſtian Name; and you ſee with what Title you are dignify'd, <hi>(viz.)</hi> with the Name of Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>And Firſt, Wonder not at what I ſay, thoſe Titles of Honour,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> As that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable than Titles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</note> which we daily hear ſounding in our Ears, and which are ſo much admired and doted upon; I mean the Titles of Emperors, Kings, Dukes, Earls, Lords, ought to be accounted as very inconſiderable in reſpect of our Chriſtian Title. They are but Earthly Glories, and will ſoon decay, and vaniſh away, but this is of a Divine Original, which will never fade, but will Ennoble you to all Eternity. I beſeech you therefore ſeriouſly conſider this, and let a due Honour and Regard to ſo worthy a Name, continually admoniſh every one of you, that you never commit in your whole Lives, any thing that does unbecome it.</p>
                  <p>I do alſo, Secondly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> Becauſe of that near Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance there is between the Chriſtian Name, and Profeſſion.</note> Entreat every One of you to conſider the near Alliance there is betwixt your Chriſtian Names, and your Chriſtian Profeſſion, inſomuch that they both began, and will both end toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In your Baptiſm you put on both your Name and your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity together, and if ever you ſhould abjure your Religion (which God forbid) you muſt alſo therewith abjure your Chriſtian Names, ſo near are they linkt one with another. And therefore let this ever admoniſh you to Adorn your ſelves with Chriſtian Graces, Temperance, Chaſtity, Charity, Juſtice, Piety; and not to defile your ſelves with Heatheniſh, Brutiſh Vices, Drunkenneſs, Uncleanneſs, Cruelty, Infidelity.</p>

Why the Chriſtians of old took Courage from this very Name, whereby they overcame all their Enemies, both Bodily and Ghoſtly, the World, the Fleſh and the Devil; and encourag'd themſelves thereby to the Diſcharge of their Chriſtian Duties. In the Vertue of this Name they extinguiſht their Luſts, they overcame Tyrants, they put to flight the Devil. Their Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors with Fire and Fagot, and all manner of cruel Torments, would have forc'd them to Blaſpheme Chriſt, to ſacrifice and

But they in the midſt of Flames and Torments would anſwer with Smiles on their Faces, We are Chriſtians, we cannot do theſe Things. Forbear your Aſſemblies and Church-meetings, would the Heathen Perſecutors ſay; We are Chriſtians, and muſt not therefore <hi>Forſake the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling our ſelves together,</hi> would they anſwer. Such great things did the Primitive Chriſtians perform under the Power of the Chriſtian Name. And let your very Chriſtian Names likewiſe, my Chriſtian Youth, encourage you to all manner of Vertuous and Religious Practices, in imitation of thoſe Bleſſed Primitive Chriſtians, and to the Examples of thoſe, that ſhall come after you.</p>

                  <p>AS the Compilers of the Catechiſm did very wiſely begin with a Queſtion and Anſwer about your Chriſtian Name, to the End, that at the mention thereof, you might take occaſion to conſider the great Obligation, which lies upon you to live according to that moſt Holy Religion, which under that Name you have receiv'd; ſo in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting upon that Queſtion and Anſwer about your Chriſtian Name, I have given you my ſelf ſome preparatory Admonitions, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make that good Uſe of thoſe Inſtructions, ſhall be given you from your Catechiſm, as to live ſuitably to them.</p>
                  <p>And being thus well prepar'd, I hope, to receive Benefit from what ſhall hereafter be deliver'd; what remains, but that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to inſtruct you in all the material Parts of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to the Belief and Practice of which you have given up your Names? This, by the Aſſiſtance of God, I ſhall endeavour to do, (and I beg your Prayers to obtain his Aſſiſtance) and in the ſame
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:151517:93"/> Method your Catechiſm teaches you;<note place="margin">Our Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm gives an entire In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in the Covenant of Grace, both generally and particularly.</note> and I am ſure I cannot chooſe a better to do it in; ſince whatſoever is neceſſary to be Believ'd and Practis'd in order to Salvation, you have therein taught you both generally, and particularly.</p>
                  <p>As to a more General Inſtitution, you have the ſumm and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Chriſtian Religion, and whatſoever is neceſſary to Salvation taught you that way, in thoſe Three Queſtions and Anſwers, which I have now read to you. The ſumm and ſubſtance of Chriſtian Religion,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> Generally in the <hi>3</hi> First Queſtions and Anſwers.</note> and whatſoever is neceſſary to Salvation, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly contain'd within the Covenant of Grace; for undoubtedly there can be nothing more of abſolute Neceſſity to Salvation, than what God himſelf has been pleas'd to Promiſe and Enſure unto us, and we our ſelves have Engag'd to perform. And now in theſe Three Queſtions and Anſwers now read to you.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, You have whatſoever pertains to the Nature of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace expreſly deliver'd. I will Inſtance to you the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, which pertain to the Nature of it, and will point to the Words wherein they are taught.</p>
                  <p>And in the firſt place you are Inſtructed, what are the Terms and Conditions whereof it conſiſts, both on God's Part, and on Ours, in theſe Words, <hi>Wherein I was made a Member of Chriſt, a Child of God, and an Inheritour of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> which are the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Favours made over to us on God's Part of the Covenant; and in theſe, <hi>Firſt, That I ſhould Renounce the Devil, and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanity of this wicked World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh. Secondly, That I ſhould Believe all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith. And Thirdly, That I ſhould keep God's Holy Will and Commandments, and walk in the ſame all the days of my Life,</hi> which are the Conditions to be perform'd on our Part of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, You have here taught you the Gracious Importance of this Covenant, we are put thereby into <hi>A State of Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, You have an Account of the Original of it, and by whoſe Mediation, you obtain'd ſo Beneficial and Gracious a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, taught you in theſe Words, <hi>Through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi> It was through the Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, that we obtain'd the Benefit of ſo Gracious a Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, You are Inſtructed by whom, and how you have been call'd into this State of Salvation, by Means of the Covenant of Grace. It was your <hi>Heavenly Father, who hath called you to this State of Salvation through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Laſtly, You are admoniſht of the very great reaſon you have to thank God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, for ſo exceeding great a Mercy, as his Calling you into it. <hi>And I thank God our Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he hath called me to this State of Salvation, thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi> Thus far you are inſtructed concerning what pertains to the Nature of the Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. You have alſo declar'd unto you, by what Sacrament, or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity you firſt enter'd into it. It was in your <hi>Baptiſm, wherein you was made a Member of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. You have then thoſe vaſt Obligations lying upon you, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and Conſcientiouſly to diſcharge your part of the Covenant laid
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:151517:93"/> plainly before you. This you own in your Anſwer to this Queſtion, <hi>Doſt thou not think, that thou art bound to Believe, and to Do as they have promis'd for thee?</hi> To which you are taught to anſwer, <hi>Yes verily ſo I will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. You have farther yet, the Means whereby you ſhall be enabled to perform your part of the Covenant. The Firſt, is the Grace, Help and Aſſiſtance of God. <hi>And by God's Help ſo I will.</hi> The Second Means, both to obtain the Divine Aſſiſtance, and to enable you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to diſcharge your Covenant, is Prayer unto God. <hi>And I Pray unto God to give me his Grace, that I may continue in the ſame unto my Lives end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Laſtly, You have alſo Intimated herein, Two material Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, relating to the making of this Covenant betwixt God and You, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The time of Infancy, wherein you enter'd into it, imply'd in theſe Words, <hi>Wherein I was made.</hi> 2. The Perſons by whom, as <hi>Proxies,</hi> you were Initiated therein. <hi>My Godfathers and Godmothers did promiſe and vow three Things in my Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will endeavour to Explain all theſe Points unto you, in this Firſt and General Part, according as they are here taught you in theſe Queſtions and Anſwers now read, as the Text, beginning</p>
                  <p>Firſt, With what pertains to the Nature of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                  <p>And in order to the Underſtanding hereof, it may not be amiſs to premiſe ſomething concerning the more general Notion of ſuch Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, as are uſually made betwixt Governours, and their Subjects. And ſuch an One, if it be perfect in all its Parts, and fully expreſt, may be Defin'd to be,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An Agreement between the Two Parties, wherein there are Promiſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Notion of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> 
                     <hi>Rewards, or profitable Conſiderations made over on one Part, and certain Conditions to be perform'd on the other. And wherein alſo, there is an Obligation on the one ſide, of undergoing ſome certain Penalties, in caſe of not performing thoſe Conditions conſented unto by him, and impos'd on him by the other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Covenant,</hi> I ſay, <hi>is a mutual Agreement between Two Parties;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">It is a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> for if it be not mutual, and both Parties are not conſenting to the Terms, the One to the making good the Promiſes, the Other to the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Conditions, the Agreement is none at all, or it is not Perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor is it Obliging on either ſide. There may be indeed a Law given by one that is Superiour in Power and Authority, which the Inferior is bound to Obey, whether he conſent, or no, becauſe he is plac'd by the Divine Ordinance, under the Other's Command, and if he does refuſe to Obey, he may be juſtly Puniſht; but then ſuch a Tranſaction is to be conſider'd as the giving of a Law, not as the making of a Covenant. Nor is this a ſlight Difference; for where a Superior has given a Law, if the Inferior has alſo Covenanted, and conſented upon good Conſiderations, and upon the Expectation of promis'd Rewards to obey that Law; ſuch a Covenant does withal lay a farther Obligation on the Party, on whom the Conditions ly to be perform'd, by vertue of his own Conſent, to do it; ſo that in the Violation of his Duty, in ſuch a caſe, he ſhall be accounted, not barely Diſobedient, but a <hi>Covenant-breaker,</hi> which is added as a more aggravated Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.31. and therefore deſerving a more ſevere Puniſhment.</p>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">As there are Conditions therein on our ſide, ſo expreſs Promiſes on the other.</note>It was farther added in the Definition, that <hi>In a Covenant there are certain Promiſes, Rewards, and profitable Conſiderations made over on one Part, on certain Conditions to be perform'd on the other.</hi> And herein alſo, with reſpect to theſe Promiſes, there ſeems to be another main Difference betwixt the Impoſing of the Law, and the Making of a Covenant. The Difference ſeems to be in this, That in the Impoſing of a Law, the Law-giver does not neceſſarily oblige himſelf to confer any Benefits, more than natural Equity does oblige him to, and it is ſufficient to the Validity of his Law to render it Obligatory, if there be a threatning of Puniſhments, great enough to deter the Subject from the Violation of that Law. But a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> does imply ſomething more comfortable in the Notion of it, and therein the Party Covenanting, tho' it be God himſelf, does graciouſly Condeſcend to oblige and bind himſelf, by expreſs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, (and uſually by ſome outward Solemnities, as viſible Signs and Seals) to the performance of ſuch Promiſes. And here alſo is another very conſiderable Difference betwixt the Obligations of a Law and a Covenant, that whereas one performance of Obedience to the Laws of a Superiour, the Subject upon ſuch his Obedience, can have only, by vertue of the Law, ſome general and faint Hopes of Benefit, ſo far as is Equitable, and as thoſe who do well, may expect to receive well. But, by vertue of a Covenant, the Party promiſing has moreover given to the other, a full aſſurance of certain Benefits to be made good to him; inſomuch that upon our Repentance and <hi>Confeſſion of our Sins, God will reckon himſelf in Juſtice and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs bound</hi> (ſince the giving of the New Covenant) <hi>to forgive us our Sins, and to cleanſe us from all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.9. So that in ſhort, A Covenant lays a greater Obligation, than the mere im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of a Law does, upon both the Parties joyn'd in Covenant; a greater Obligation, I ſay, upon the One, to perform the Conditions, upon the other, to make good the Promiſes. And let this ſuffice to have remark'd upon the more general Notion and Nature of a Covenant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A View of the Covenant of Grace.</note>But for our better underſtanding the diſtinct Nature and Notion of the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> in particular, we muſt take our Riſe from the very Creation, and conſider the ſeveral Diſpenſations of God, by way of Covenant with Mankind. And to begin with the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him with all Mankind; the whole Proceeding ſtands thus:<note place="margin">God having made Man upright, and in a capacity never to have violated his Covenant, did Engage him to a perfect, exact, and unſinning O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</note> God having made Man upright, and given him a great meaſure of Light to direct him, and of Strength to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him to do, as he ſhould appoint; proceeded then to make this very reaſonable Covenant and Agreement with him. He agreed to continue and increaſe that Light and Strength to him, and to reward his acting according to it with immortal Life and Happineſs, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he making uſe of his Underſtanding and Power, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere to obey his Maker's Commands, which if he ſhould not do, in every particular Inſtance of Duty, he threatned him with Death, and eternal Miſery. But then leaving him to act according to that freedom of Will, wherewith as a reaſonable Creature he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd him,<note place="margin">Man did violate it.</note> Man did by his own voluntary Diſobedience, thro' the Cunning of Satan, tempting him thereto, tranſgreſs the Law given
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:151517:94"/> him by his Maker, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. and did thereby caſt himſelf into a State of Sin and Miſery under the Bondage of Satan, without any power, or poſſibility to recover himſelf out of that wretched Condition. And thus he broke his Covenant with God, Sinn'd againſt his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and ſo forfeited all the Happineſs, convey'd to him therein, both for himſelf, and his Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>And now was Man in a deſperate and forlorn Condition: His own Sin had made him liable to the ſevereſt Strokes of God's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure; and the Divine Juſtice, and Wiſdom,<note place="margin">The Divine Juſtice, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs requir'd ſatisfaction.</note> and Holineſs would not permit the Almighty (however his Goodneſs inclin'd him to Pity) to let his Sin go unpuniſht, and to reſtore him to a capacity of Happineſs, without a valuable <hi>Satisfaction</hi> made to infinite Juſtice, ſuch as ſhould ſhew the Divine hatred of, and ſeverity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sin, for the ſecurity of his Government in the World: And yet no Creature in the Heavens above, or in the Earth beneath, was ſufficient for ſo great an Undertaking, as to ſatisfy for him, For <hi>There is no Man can Redeem his Brother, or pay God a Ranſom for him, for the Redemption of his Soul is precious,</hi> Pſal. 49.7. And what now ſhall be done to reſcue Mankind out of this miſerable State? Why,<note place="margin">Man being himſelf unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to make it, by leſs than ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment.</note> when unhappy Man was in this deſperate and forlorn Condition, paſt all hopes of Remedy, or Recovery, then did God's unſpeakable Goodneſs chooſe to appear; for to the wonder of Men and Angels, he does himſelf find out this way, to raiſe us out of the Abyſs of Miſery, into a State of Happineſs again, that he <hi>So loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life,</hi> Joh. 3.16.</p>
                  <p>So infinitely great, I ſay, were the Mercies of God to us,<note place="margin">The Son of God under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took.</note> and ſo admirable was his Wiſdom in the Expreſſion of 'em, that he himſelf contriv'd (when no one elſe could) this Expedient for our Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance out of this deſperate and forlorn State: <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> To ſatisfy for the Breach of the Firſt.</note> Becauſe his Juſtice muſt be ſatisfied for the Breach of his Covenant, and yet on the other ſide he would not have us eternally Puniſht, he therefore gave his own Son to dye in our ſtead, and by the infinite Merit of his Sufferings, to make Satisfaction to infinite Juſtice, which we could not, ſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>He made him to be Sin,</hi> or a Sin-offering for us, <hi>who knew no Sin, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> And then <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> To Cancel it, and in its ſtead to make a Covenant of Grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable in our fallen State.</note> Becauſe it was impoſſible to be Sav'd by the Firſt Covenant, which required Unſinning Obedience, which we in our fallen State could not perform; he gave him therefore to Cancel the <hi>Firſt Covenant,</hi> and by his Blood-ſhedding to Purchaſe for us a <hi>Second,</hi> whoſe Terms and Conditions being more poſſible and eaſy, we might be capable of obtaining Salvation under it. Hence is he ſtyl'd, <hi>The Mediatour of a better Covenant,</hi> Heb. 8.6.

                  <p>And the Terms and Conditions of this Second Covenant,<note place="margin">Wherein Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Faith, and a ſincere Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, inſtead of a perfect, exact, and unſinning O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</note> being no more a perfect, exact and unſinning Obedience; Repentance is henceforward to be admitted as a means of Reconciliation, and a ſincere Obedience, to the beſt of our Power, will be accepted; and Faith in God, and in Jeſus Chriſt, accompany'd with Living like thoſe, who Believe the Goſpel, ſhall be henceforward imputed to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:151517:95"/> our Juſtification; ſo that we ſhall have our Sins pardon'd, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd to Happineſs: This in ſhort was the Tenour both of the firſt Covenant, made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Second, procur'd for us by the Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt. Not to ſpeak here of the different Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Degrees of its Promulgation; nor of that Legal Covenant whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Mediatour, and was made only with the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and was annex'd as an Appendix and Codicil to this Covenant of Grace, for Reaſons too many, and too large now to be conſider'd. For tho' to ſhew how, that the whole Promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this gracious Covenant, was not made all at once, but that it ſeem'd good to the Divine Wiſdom, that ſo ſtupendious and grand a Scene of Mercy, ſhould not be open'd but by degrees; tho' to ſhew this, I ſay, and the ſeveral Reaſons of adding this Legal Covenant to the Covenant of Grace, may be uſeful Points of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity to be explain'd in their due time, yet I look upon 'em, as none of the <hi>Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt,</hi> but rather part of that <hi>Strong meat,</hi> ſpoke of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14. <hi>which belongeth to them who are of full Age,</hi> and have been already competently well inſtructed, and ſo to be no proper Matter of Catechetical Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>To proceed therefore, and in a word, we may conſider the <hi>Second Covenant,</hi> not as ſuch indeed, which is made betwixt a Maſter and his Servant, wherein the Maſter engages to allow Meat, Drink, and Wages, on Condition the Servant will perform unto him ſuch and ſuch Services, which are juſt and reaſonable, and the Servant is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to perform, which expreſſes more the Nature of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, <hi>Do this and Live:</hi> But rather, (for this comes nearer to the Nature of the Covenant of Grace, between God and us, which is full of advantageous and profitable Conſiderations on our ſide) we may rather compare it,<note place="margin">It reſembles Articles of Accomodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made thro' the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of a Prince's El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Son, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</note> I ſay, to an Accord, made betwixt a Gracious Prince, and his Rebellious Subjects, as ſuppoſe ſome City, or State, wherein the Prince is graciouſly pleas'd, through the Interceſſion of ſome great Favourite, to grant unto thoſe his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, not only Pardon of their former Crimes; but moreover, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain great Priviledges and Freedoms, Protection, and ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Favours, Lands and Poſſeſſions, and the like; on Condition they will thence-forward Renounce and Forſake all his Enemies, and place no farther Truſt nor Confidence in 'em; and will not Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey him for the future in any of his juſt and reaſonable Commands, but pay him a true and faithful Obedience to all his Laws.</p>
                  <p>And much of the ſame Nature, I ſay, is the Covenant of Grace, made betwixt God and all Chriſtians, thro' the Mediation of his only Son, only with this difference: That on God's Part, the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and Advantages are of moſt infinite Value, which are made over to us his Rebellious and Diſobedient Subjects; and this upon the moſt reaſonable, juſt and eaſy Conditions, conſidering the Aſſiſtance he affords us, by the vertue of the ſame Covenant, to perform 'em. For Almighty God, in the firſt place, vouchſafes us in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to be made <hi>Members of Chriſt, Children of God, and Inheritours of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> which are Mercies and Priviledges of invaluable Benefit and Advantage to us: And we on the other ſide, Engage, and Promiſe, but to <hi>Renounce the Devil, and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanity of this wicked World, and all the ſinful
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:151517:95"/> Luſts of the Fleſh; to Believe all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith; to Obey God's holy Will and Commandments, and to walk in the ſame all the days of our Life;</hi> which, I ſay, are moſt reaſonable, juſt, and eaſy Conditions, conſidering the Aſſiſtance he will afford us, to enable us to perform 'em.</p>
                  <p>This will very clearly appear, by that time I have Explain'd to you, diſtinctly, and ſeverally, the Terms and Articles of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; both the Advantages made over to us on God's part, and the Conditions to be perform'd on ours, as they are taught you in the Words, now read to you.</p>
                  <p>And it is a Subject, indeed, that does extreamly concern you to be well Inſtructed in, and to be conſider'd by you. None of you ſhall be able to perform a Bargain, except you know, what you have bargain'd and agreed to do. No One can diſcharge a Bond, except he knows diſtinctly what he is oblig'd to pay; no more can any of you be able to perform the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> except you do well underſtand the Nature, Terms, and Conditions of it.</p>
                  <p>And, indeed,<note place="margin">Little more of univerſal Concernment to be known, but the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of this Covenant.</note> there is perhaps but little neceſſary to be known in Religion, beſides the Articles of this Covenant. We may without Prejudice to our Salvation, doubtleſs, be ignorant of many Points, that are Canvaſt with Heat enough, in the Controverſies of Men of all Perſwaſions; but to know what ineſtimable Bleſſings God has Promis'd and Enſur'd to us, and what we are to perform to make our ſelves <hi>Inheritours</hi> of thoſe Bleſſings, is what every Body, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves a future State, and the Immortality of his Soul, and that it is worth his while, to ſtudy the Salvation of his Soul, muſt think it neceſſary, except he can imagine it ſafe to take his Journey to Heaven blindfold, when he cannot think of getting, but to his ſhort Home here on Earth, without his Eyes open.</p>
                  <p>A diſtinct and clear Underſtanding of the Nature, Terms, and Conditions, and of all that pertains to the Covenant of Grace, is, without doubt, of all things in the World, the moſt neceſſary.<note place="margin">The Cateche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Method moſt uſeful to that Purpoſe.</note> And there is no Method of Inſtruction, whereby it can be ſo diſtinctly and clearly known, as the Catechetical way: For not to ſay, that Preaching, now upon one Head, and immediately after upon another, without any dependance and coherence of the ſeveral parts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity together, is not ſo likely to give Perſons a clear underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the whole Nature and Deſign of Chriſtianity, as may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite: The Catechetical way, by treating orderly on all the Parts of our moſt Holy Religion, and by giving thereby, a diſtinct View of their natural Connection with, and Dependance one upon another, has this Excellency in it, no doubt, that thereby Perſons ſhall be better able to judge of the beautiful Contexture, and admirable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of the whole; and ſhall eaſily diſcern what End it is, that Chriſtianity aims at, and how admirably every Part of it, is fitted to carry on that great End.</p>
                  <p>It is, without all doubt, a moſt uſeful Method of Inſtruction, and it would ſoon appear to be ſo, in its happy Effects, would all Perſons but lay aſide their unhappy Prejudices againſt it, as if it were proper only for Children, to be Hearers thereof: Whereas, indeed, it is no ways unbecoming the Eldeſt, and moſt Knowing Perſons, to hear the great and fundamental Doctrines of Religion, explain'd, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:151517:96"/> handled diſtinctly and clearly, and ſeparated from all unneceſſary Mixtures.</p>
                  <p>But where all the Means and Methods of Inſtruction are little enough, to give Men a ſufficient Underſtanding in all that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation; inſtead of comparing 'em one with another, we had better to make uſe of all, and to Pray to God to give a Bleſſing to all his Ordinances, that every one may be uſeful to the Edification, and Salvation of every Chriſtian; which, that they may all prove, may God Almighty grant of his infinite Goodneſs, thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Lord: To whom with the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, be all Honour and Glory, now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>THE Preliminary Queſtions and Anſwers of your Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, do give you a general Account of all the Terms and Conditions of the Covenant of Grace, both of the Priviledges made over to us by God, and of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to be perform'd by us. And theſe Words, <hi>Wherein I was made a Member of Chriſt,</hi> expreſſing the Firſt of thoſe invaluable Priviledges made over unto us, in this Covenant, on God's Part; I ſhall therefore endeavour, as well as I can, to explain and open to you, what they do import.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt is in Scripture often ſtyl'd, The Head of the Church, as particularly <hi>Col.</hi> 1.8. <hi>And he is the Head of the Body, the Church,</hi> it is there ſaid; and we are alſo ſtyl'd, Members of this Body, the Church. Thus <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.30. <hi>We are Members of his Body, of his Fleſh, and of his Bones;</hi> ſo that to be a Member of Chriſt, is to be a Member,<note place="margin">A Member of Chriſt, is a Member of Christ's Church.</note> or Part of that Body, of which he is the Head, or to be a Member of Chriſt's Church: And to make it appear to you, how happy a Thing it is to be a Member of Chriſt's Church,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I will ſhew you, <hi>What kind of Body the Church of Chriſt is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>What it is to be a Member of it.</hi> And then</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>What exceeding great and invaluable Priviledges do belong to a Member of Chriſt's Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Firſt, let us ſee, <hi>What kind of Body that is which is call'd the Church of Chriſt.</hi> And tho' it does not belong to this Part of your Catechiſm, to give you a full account, of all that is neceſſary to be known, concerning Chriſt's Church, which may more properly be refer'd to that Article of our Creed, <hi>I believe the Holy Catholick Church:</hi> However, ſince the high Priviledge and Dignity of any <hi>Member,</hi> as a <hi>Member,</hi> cannot be ſufficiently underſtood, nor valued, without knowing the Nature and Excellency of that <hi>Body,</hi> of which it is a <hi>Member;</hi> I do therefore think my ſelf obliged, in order to let you into a through Underſtanding of what is meant by <hi>A Member of Chriſt's Church,</hi> and of the greatneſs of that Priviledge, to ſpeak ſomething largely, in this Place, concerning the Nature and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Church it ſelf; and I ſhall therefore define it, and alſo Explain, and prove each Part of the Definition, I ſhall give of it, as follows:</p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:151517:97"/>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A Definition of Chriſt's Church.</note>The <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> is the univerſal Society of Chriſtians, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting both of Lawful Governours and Paſtors, and alſo of the People of God committed to their Charge; and who are call'd forth out of the wicked World, by the Preaching of the Goſpel, to a holy Profeſſion and Calling; Namely, To Repentance from dead Works, to the Knowledge, Belief, and Service of the One True God, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and Holy Ghoſt, and to the Enjoyment of thoſe ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Priviledges of the Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi> Moſt reaſonable and excellent Laws to Conduct 'em to Heaven, Divine Grace and Aſſiſtance to Enable 'em to obey thoſe Laws, Pardon of Sins, upon Repentance, for the Violation of 'em, and eternal Life and Happineſs upon ſincere Obedience to 'em. And who, to the End of being Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into one Society, and of having <hi>God, to be their God, and they themſelves his People,</hi> have Enter'd into Covenant with him, at Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and do often Renew the ſame in the Lord's Supper, and are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated thereby into one Body, ſubdivided, indeed, into ſeveral particular Bodies, and Churches, for the convenience of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Worſhip, but holding Communion with one another, in One and the ſame neceſſary and fundamental Points of Chriſtianity, neceſſary to conſtitute the Church, under Jeſus Chriſt, their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Head.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Church of Chriſt a well-ordered Society, wherein ſome are Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, ſome Governed.</note>And Firſt, <hi>The Church of Chriſt is the Society of Chriſtians, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both of Lawful Governours and Paſtors, and of the People of God committed to their Charge.</hi> The Church of Chriſt is not a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd, an Undigeſted, Headleſs Multitude, but a Regular and Well-order'd Society. Hence, it is ſo often in the New Teſtament call'd, <hi>The Kingdom of God,</hi> as Matth. 21.31. <hi>The Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. and <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Matth. 11.12. and the Members of it, <hi>Children of the Kingdom,</hi> Matth. 13.38. And <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.19, 20, 21. The Members therefore are ſtyl'd, <hi>Fellow-Citizens, Members of a Houſhold,</hi> and Parts of a <hi>Temple,</hi> all which Expreſſions ſpeak the Church of Chriſt to be a Regular Society of Men, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin'd and knit together by Laws, derived from ſome ſupreme Head and Governour. A Society, I ſay, wherein ſome are Superiours, ſome are Inferiours, ſome Governours, ſome Governed, and who altogether make up a well-compacted Body of Men. This laſt cited place out of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> ſpeaks the Thing out: <hi>Now therefore,</hi> ſaith he to thoſe, who are call'd into the Church, <hi>ye are no more Strangers and Forreigners, but Fellow-Citizens with the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God, and are built upon the Foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets,</hi> that is, Governours and Teachers, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt being the chief Corner-ſtone, in whom all the Building, fitly framed together, groweth up into an Holy Temple in the Lord.</hi> Here, in this Deſcription of the Church, you have Jeſus Chriſt the <hi>chief Corner-ſtone,</hi> or Head of the Building, and Body; the Apoſtles and Prophets <hi>Foundation-ſtones,</hi> next unto him, and all the reſt of Chriſtians <hi>Fellow-Citizens,</hi> depending upon Jeſus Chriſt, their ſupreme Head, and others his ſubordinate Governours, and Teachers, next under him, and the Whole repreſented as a well-compacted <hi>Building.</hi> Or, to make it yet more clear to you, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12. it is ſaid, that <hi>He gave ſome, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: and ſome, Prophets: and ſome, Evangeliſts: and ſome, Paſtors and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:151517:97"/> Teachers, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the Edifying of the Body of Chriſt.</hi> So that upon the whole Matter, you ſee, that the Church of Chriſt is a well-order'd Society of Men.</p>
                  <p>And I do withal ſay, that in the Conſtitution of Chriſt's Church it is requir'd, that the <hi>Governours and Paſtors</hi> thereof be <hi>Lawful</hi> Ones, that is, ſuch as Chriſt has Commiſſion'd to thoſe Offices, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if they uſurp the ſacred Offices of the Church, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lawfully Ordain'd to the ſame, by the Succeſſors of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, there will be very great danger of a Nullity in all their Miniſterial Acts and Offices. You muſt all needs underſtand this, That thoſe, who ſhall pretend to act in any Office, by the King's Authority, without a true Commiſſion, the King will be ſo far from reckoning himſelf oblig'd, to Confirm what they ſhall pretend to do in his Name, that he will puniſh the Preſumption of ſuch Officers, and thoſe that adhere to 'em. And what reaſon have thoſe to expect better Treatment from the King of Heaven, who ſhall either take upon themſelves the Miniſtry, or receive an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to it from thoſe Hands, who have no Power to confer it, or ſhall Adhere to ſuch Uſurping Miniſters? To put the caſe as Favourably, as poſſibly we can, it does not appear, that God is under any Promiſe, or Engagement to hear the Prayers, that ſuch Miniſters ſhall put for the People, to convey the Graces of his Holy Spirit, by the Sacraments they ſhall Adminiſter, or to Ratify the Pardon of thoſe Penitents, whom they ſhall Abſolve; whereas he has aſſured the Church, with reſpect to his lawful Miniſters, that whatſoever of this Nature they ſhall do on Earth, ſhall be Eſtabliſh'd in Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.19. And we are farther told by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Heb. 5.4. That under the Old Law, <hi>No man took the Honour</hi> of the Prieſthood <hi>unto himſelf, but thoſe who were called of God,</hi> as was <hi>Aaron.</hi> And as to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, St. <hi>Paul</hi> does ſharply demand, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. <hi>How any ſhall Preach</hi> the Goſpel, <hi>except they be ſent?</hi> So that it does extreamly concern all Chriſtian People, that the Governours and Paſtors of the Church be lawful Ones, ſuch as are Sent, Ordain'd, and Commiſſion'd thereunto.</p>
                  <p>And now, if you would be well ſatisfy'd, who are certainly Sent,<note place="margin">An Epiſcopal Clergy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſuch.</note> Ordain'd and Commiſſion'd to Govern and Teach in the Church; it is beyond all doubt, that Biſhops are lawful Governours in the Church of Chriſt, and that thoſe, who are Ordain'd by their Hands, have Commiſſion to Preach the Goſpel, and Adminiſter the Sacraments, becauſe they do undoubtedly derive their Power by an uninterrupted Succeſſion from Chriſt and his Apoſtles; for our Saviour, when he ſent forth his Diſciples into the World, to Preach the Goſpel, and to gather a Church, he told 'em, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. <hi>He would be with them,</hi> or ſtand by 'em in giving Authority and Succeſs to their Miniſtry, <hi>to the end of the world;</hi> and yet for certain, for 1500 Years he did Authorize no other, than thoſe Epiſcopally Ordain'd, as the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of all Ages of the Church do teſtify; ſo that it concerns you, who have not that Neceſſity to plead for not Enjoying Biſhops, and an Epiſcopal Clergy, as our Siſter Churches Beyond-Sea think they have; It concerns you, I ſay, as you would be ſecure of being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Pale</hi> of a right Conſtituted Goſpel-Church, not to ſeparate
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:151517:98"/> your ſelves from this, wherein you are undoubtedly under a true <hi>Goſpel Miniſtry.</hi> But to proceed</p>

                     <note place="margin">The Church is the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Society of Christians, taking in men of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well of the Gentiles, as of the Jews.</note>Secondly, The Church of Chriſt is the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Society of Chriſtians.</hi> The Chriſtian Church is not now confin'd to one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Place, or Nation, as the Jewiſh was; but is <hi>Catholick</hi> and Univerſal, ſpread over all the Face of the Earth, and taking in all Nations of Men, as well thoſe, who were <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as thoſe, who were <hi>Jews: For Chriſt is our Peace, and hath made both One, and hath broken down the middle Wall of Partition between us,</hi> Eph. 2.14. The Synagogue of the <hi>Jews</hi> conſiſted of one Nation, and the more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Parts of their publick Worſhip, were confin'd to one Place, as you will ſee, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.5, 6. So that it was rightly ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.20. Tho' the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> did Schiſmatically queſtion it, That <hi>Jeruſalem was the place wherein men ought to worſhip;</hi> For the Temple was the only place in which the Sacrifices could be Offer'd, and wherein the Prieſts could perform their daily Miniſtration; ſo that the Church, under the Law, was an Incloſure divided from all the World beſides. But our Saviour, at the opening of the Chriſtian Church, aſſures the Woman, who demanded of him, <hi>Whether in that Mountain,</hi> near to <hi>Samaria,</hi> whereon they both ſtood, <hi>or in Jeruſalem, were the place where men ought to worſhip,</hi> he aſſures her, <hi>The hour cometh when neither in that Mountain, nor yet at Jeruſalem, they ſhould worſhip the Father;</hi> that is, not there only, nor any where in ſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal a manner, <hi>Joh</hi> 4.20, 21, 22, 23. But as St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, now under the Goſpel, <hi>In every Nation, he that feareth God, and worketh Righteouſneſs, is accepted of him,</hi> Act. 10.35. And therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, when he ſent forth his Diſciples into the World, to Preach the Goſpel, and to gather a Church, he commanded them, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15. ſaying, <hi>Go ye into all the World, and preach the Goſpel to every Creature.</hi> From whence we find them, in <hi>Revelations</hi> 5.9. Crying unto the Lamb, <hi>Thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us unto God by thy Blood, out of every Kindred, and Tongue, and People, and Nation.</hi> So, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as concerning the Jewiſh Church it was, that God declar'd former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5, 6. That in keeping his Covenant, they ſhould be a <hi>peculiar Treaſure unto him, above all People, a Kingdom of Prieſts, and a holy Nation.</hi> Now under the Goſpel it is declar'd, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. with reſpect to Perſons of all Nations, who ſhall come within the Chriſtian Church, that they are a <hi>Choſen Generation, a Royal Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, an holy Nation, a peculiar People, that they ſhould ſhew forth the Praiſes of him, who hath call'd them out of Darkneſs, into his marvellous Light:</hi> But then, I ſay, the Church of Chriſt, tho' it takes in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all Nations, yet it is ſtill to be a <hi>Holy Nation, a peculiar People.</hi> For tho' it be ſpread over all the World, yet</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">It conſiſts of ſuch, who are called out of the World, by the preaching of the Goſpel, to a holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and Calling.</note>Thirdly, It conſiſts only of ſuch, who are <hi>Called forth out of the wicked World, by the Preaching of the Goſpel, to a Holy Profeſſion and Calling.</hi> It is not either Jews, or Gentiles, whilſt they continue ſuch, that are of the Church of Chriſt; but it conſiſts of thoſe, who are Call'd out from amongſt both. The Church is a ſelected People, ſeparated from the Profane part of the World, to be a <hi>Choſen Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, a Royal Prieſthood, a Holy Nation, a Peculiar People.</hi> To un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand which, you muſt know, that the World, at the time of our Saviour's coming into it, was grown to a ſad paſs, and was miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:151517:98"/> Eſtrang'd from God. The world, indeed, ſoon after the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, began to fall off from God, and to take part with the Devil: But by the time that our Saviour came into the Fleſh, the Apoſtle declares, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.11, 12. concerning as well Jews, as Gentiles, that there <hi>was none that underſtood, there was none that ſought after God; that they were all gone out of the way, they were all become unprofitable, that there was none that did good, no not one.</hi> Particularly, as to the Gentiles, they were charg'd, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.23, 24.28, 29. to have <hi>Changed the Glory of the incorruptible God, into an Image made like to corruptible Man, and to Birds, and four-footed Beaſts, and creeping things; and were thereupon given up to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, and vile Affections; and as they did not like to retain God in their Knowledge, they were given up to a reprobate Mind, being filled with all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs, Fornication, Wickedneſs,</hi> &amp;c. And as to the Jews, they had in a manner wholly voided the Force of God's Laws, by their falſe Interpretations, as you will ſee in our Saviour's Sermon on the Mount, which coſt him ſo much Pains to clear the Text from their falſe Gloſſes, and to ſhew them the full Extent of their Duty, contain'd in the Law. This was the State of both Jews and Gentiles, at that time: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did Chriſt come to <hi>Call out</hi> ſuch, as would obey his Calls, <hi>to Call 'em out,</hi> I ſay, <hi>out of the wicked World, to a holy Profeſſion and Calling;</hi> for which reaſon he is ſaid to have <hi>Saved us, and called us with an holy Calling,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9. and in a great many Places of Scripture, Chriſtians are therefore ſtyl'd, the <hi>Called;</hi> and <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.6. they are ſaid to be ſuch, whom the <hi>Father had given our Saviour out of the world,</hi> and tho' <hi>they are in the world,</hi> ver. 11. that is, Live in the World, yet <hi>they are not of the world,</hi> ver. 16.</p>
                  <p>True it is, It is not every Member of the viſible Church, that does effectually obey this Holy Calling, and in his Life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, ſhews himſelf not to be of the World; and therefore it is, that the Kingdom of Heaven, that is, the Church, is liken'd <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.24. <hi>to a Field,</hi> in which Wheat and Tares grow up together until the Harveſt; and to a Net that was caſt into the Sea, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd of every Kind: But however, tho' too many of thoſe, of whom the Church is compos'd, are in their own Perſons Ungodly, yet, I ſay,</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They are <hi>Called, by the Preaching of the Goſpel, to a Holy Profeſſion and Calling,</hi> as Namely, to Repentance from Dead Works;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> Repentance from Dead Works.</note> for ſo our Saviour ſays, <hi>He came to Call the ſinners to Repentance,</hi> Matth. 9.13. And thus alſo his Apoſtles <hi>Preacht unto Men, that they ſhould turn from the Vanities of Idol-worſhip, unto the Living God, which made Heaven, and Earth, and the Sea, and all things therein,</hi> Acts 14.15. which is an Inſtance of Repentance, that the Gentile World were particularly Call'd to.</p>
                  <p>And then as to the <hi>Knowledge and Belief of the only True God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> To the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Belief and Service of the One True God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</note> 
                     <hi>and Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> the diſtinguiſhing Character given of the Church of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2. is, that they are ſuch, whom the Father <hi>hath given him</hi> (or <hi>given him out of the world,</hi> as it is <hi>ver.</hi> 6.) that they <hi>might have Eternal Life;</hi> and <hi>this,</hi> he tells us, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>is Eternal Life;</hi> or the way by which we can only come by Eternal Life, <hi>That we know the only True God, and Jeſus Chriſt, whom he hath ſent.</hi> The Gentiles they knew not the only True God, but Own'd and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip'd
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:151517:99"/> many Gods, and did Sacrifice to Devils, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.20. And as for the Jews, tho' they Believ'd, indeed, in the only True God, yet they Acknowledg'd not his Son Jeſus Chriſt, whom he had ſent, to be alſo the <hi>True God,</hi> as he is call'd, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.20. And now both theſe Enemies to Truth, our Saviour calls <hi>the world,</hi> Joh. 17. and in Oppoſition to both tells us, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. that <hi>This is Life Eternal, to know the only True God, and Jeſus Chriſt, whom he hath ſent.</hi> So that the Church of Chriſt are ſuch, who are peculiarly Separated from the World, to the Knowledge and Belief of the Only True God.</p>
                  <p>And they are ſuch alſo, who have been Baptized into the <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Belief, and Service of Three Perſons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, in that One Godhead,</hi> Mat. 28.19. And particularly they are ſuch as are <hi>Baptized into the Name of Jeſus,</hi> Acts 19.5. that is, into the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, That Jeſus is the Chriſt, or Mediatour between God and Man, for this is the great Fundamental Doctrine of Chriſtianity, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. aſſuring us, that <hi>Other Foundation can no man lay, than that Jeſus is the Chriſt.</hi> And he, that <hi>denyeth that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is the great Liar, and an Anti-Chriſt,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.22. But, <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth, that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is Born of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.1. that is, is Adopted into the Chriſtian Church and Family.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>III.</hi> To enjoy the Priviledges of the Goſpel.</note>Fifthly, And as Chriſtians are a Society of Perſons, call'd out of the World to Repentance, Faith, and Goſpel-Obedience; ſo to the <hi>Enjoyment of thoſe Ineſtimable Priviledges of the Goſpel,</hi> viz. 1. Moſt Reaſonable and Excellent Laws, given by a moſt Great and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Governour, to Conduct 'em to Heaven, <hi>Laws writ in their Minds, and in their Hearts,</hi> Heb. 8.10. that is, Laws, which are for the moſt part, the very Dictates of natural Reaſon. 2. They are ſuch, as are Priviledg'd with having great Meaſures of Divine Grace, and Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to enable 'em to Obey thoſe Laws, for, whereas the <hi>Law was given by Moſes, Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 1.17. and is the Priviledge of the Church of Chriſt under the Goſpel. 3. They are ſuch, who have Aſſurance of Pardon of Sins, upon their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for the Tranſgreſſion of thoſe Laws, for, with reſpect to thoſe of the Chriſtian Church, God is pleas'd to ſay, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.12. <hi>I will be merciful to their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs, and their Sins and Iniquities will I remember no more.</hi> And laſtly, As to the Eternal Life and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, Chriſt does aſſure us, <hi>Joh</hi> 17.2. that <hi>The Father has given him power over all Fleſh, that he ſhould give Eternal Life to as many as are given him,</hi> or are <hi>given him out of the World,</hi> ver. 6. that is, that he has a Power of conferring the Rewards in Heaven, to as many as come within the Pale of the Church, if they do withal live in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to its Laws and Conſtitutions. Thus is the Church of Chriſt a Society of Men, call'd forth of the World, as to a moſt Holy Profeſſion and Calling, ſo to the Enjoyment of moſt ſingular Priviledges.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Church are ſuch, who to the End of being Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into one Society, and of having God to be their</note>Sixthly, And they are ſuch, <hi>Who to the End of being Incorporated into One Society, and of having God, to be their God, and they themſelves his People, have Enter'd into Covenant with him.</hi> It is the Royal Charter granted by the King, to the Members of a Corporation, or City, whereby they have certain Priviledges granted them from the King, and wherein they are Tied to diſcharge certain Duties to him, and to One another, that makes 'em, of a confus'd Multitude, to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:151517:99"/> become a Corporation, or regulated Society. And thoſe who ſtand out, and will not accept of thoſe Priviledges, nor oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their ſeveral Duties, ſhall not be reputed of that Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, nor receive any Advantages from it. And ſo it is here with that Society, which is call'd the Church of Chriſt. It is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, granted us by the King of Heaven, wherein we have the moſt ineſtimable Priviledges, thoſe contain'd in the Goſpel, graciouſly Enſur'd unto us, and moſt reaſonable Duties both to God and Man, required of us, that do embody and join us into one Spiritual Society, the Church; and thoſe who will not Enter into ſuch a Covenant with God, are <hi>Aliens from the Commonwealth of Iſrael, and Strangers from the Covenants of Promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the world,</hi> Eph. 2.12. But thoſe who have join'd themſelves in Covenant with Him, are <hi>No more Strangers and Forreigners, but Fellow-Citizens with the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God,</hi> ver. 19.</p>
                  <p>And as by being United in one Covenant, Chriſtians are Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated into one Society; ſo by the ſame Means it comes to paſs alſo, that they have <hi>God to be their God, peculiarly, and they become his People.</hi> Thus <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. <hi>This is the Covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael after thoſe days,</hi> that is, in the time of the Goſpel, <hi>I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a People.</hi> It is the Nature of all Covenants, to Unite the Parties Covenanting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and to give to each Party an Intereſt in the other. <hi>I entred into Covenant with thee, and thou becameſt mine,</hi> Ezek. 16.8. So that by having Enter'd into Covenant with God, we are Entitled to his particular Protection and Care over us, and we give to him thereby a new and ſtronger Claim to our Obedience.</p>

And hence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. it is ſaid, That <hi>we are all Baptiz'd into one Body,</hi> or admitted by Baptiſm into one Church.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, And they are appointed to <hi>Renew the ſame,</hi>

                  </p>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:151517:100"/> Body, and one Spirit, even as ye are all called in one Hope of your Calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all;</hi> where you ſee, that becauſe all Chriſtians are call'd out of the World, into one Hope of their Calling, or to the Enjoyment of the ſame Priviledges, to one Faith, or to Believe one God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, expreſt here by one Spirit, one Lord, one God, and Father of all; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Incorporated by one Baptiſm, or by the Uſe of the ſame Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that therefore they are one Body. The Covenant of Grace, that great Charter, whereby we are Incorporated into one Society, is One and the ſame amongſt all Chriſtians, containing the ſame Duties to be perform'd by all, and promiſing to every one that performs thoſe Conditions, the ſame Priviledges. And all Men are every where admitted and continued in it by the ſame Sacramental Solemnities, and therefore the Church founded upon, and Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by that Covenant, muſt needs be One.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, This one Body or Society, the Church, true it is, is <hi>Subdivided into ſeveral particular Bodies, or Churches,</hi>

Hence we read, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. and 3. chap. of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> all which were ſo many Cities in the Leſſer <hi>Aſia;</hi> and the Biſhops of thoſe Churches are ſtyl'd, the <hi>Angels</hi> of thoſe Churches, in thoſe Second and Third Chapters of <hi>Revelations.</hi> And the Elders, or Biſhops of theſe Churches, probably it was, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſent for, to meet him at <hi>Miletus,</hi> Act. 20.17. and to whom he gave that ſolemn Charge, <hi>ver.</hi> 21.28. <hi>To take heed unto themſelves, and to all the Flock, over the which the Holy Ghoſt had made them Overſeers, to feed the Church of God,</hi> that is, to Govern and Teach the Church of Chriſt, <hi>which he had Purchaſed with his own Blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as for the <hi>Convenience of Government,</hi> the Church of Chriſt was anciently divided into Dioceſan Churches, in which Conſtitution of the Church, each City has its Biſhop to govern and direct the Affairs of the Church:<note place="margin">

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:151517:100"/> it is, the Church, which is but one Body, is Subdivided into ſeveral particular Bodies, or Churches; both for the convenience of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Government, and alſo for the convenience of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: But however thoſe ſeveral particular Churches were <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited into one Body, by one Covenant;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">But however <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited, by one Covenant, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one Body.</note> for the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the Church of <hi>Epheſus, Smyrna,</hi> &amp;c. were are all <hi>called</hi> to the ſame Holy Profeſſion and Calling, to the ſame Faith in God, and to the ſame Priviledges of Grace, Pardon, and Happineſs, as the whole Church, and were admitted into that ſame Covenant, by the ſame Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as the whole Catholick Church was; by which means <hi>They kept the unity of the Spirit, in the bond of Peace,</hi> Eph. 4.3. And each of thoſe particular Congregations, alſo in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> for Inſtance, were United alſo to the Church of God, in that City, by holding no other than the Doctrine Eſtabliſh'd in that Church: And by being United thereby to that particular Part of Chriſt's Church, they were United alſo to the whole Body of Chriſt, and made up but one Body, <hi>For as the Body is one, and hath many Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and all the Members of that one Body being many, are one Body; ſo alſo is Chriſt, or the Chriſtian Church, for by one Spirit, we are all Baptized into one Body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be Bond or Free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.12, 13. So that the Church of Chriſt, you ſee, tho' divided into many Branches, or Members, is but one Body in the whole, becauſe United in, and by One and the ſame Covenant of Grace: And alſo in the</p>
                  <p>Eleventh Place,<note place="margin">As alſo by holding Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with each other, in hearing the Word, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayers, Sacraments, and in afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to each other mutual Aſſiſtances.</note> Becauſe all the ſeveral particular Churches are to <hi>Hold Communion with each other.</hi> Now as to that Communion, which the Members of Chriſt's Church held with one another in the Apoſtle's Times; (and ſure their's muſt be a Pattern of Church-Communion) we are told, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. that it conſiſted in this, That <hi>They continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles Doctrine, and Fellowſhip, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers. They continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles Doctrine,</hi> that is, they continued conſtantly, and alſo ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, without ſwerving aſide by Separation, in Hearing the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Teach. They continued alſo ſtedfaſtly in <hi>Breaking of Bread, and in Prayers,</hi> that is, they Join'd conſtantly and frequently in the ſame Prayers and Sacraments. And laſtly, They continued ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſame <hi>Fellowſhip,</hi> by which is principally meant in the Original, both here, and in ſeveral other Places of the Scripture, that Communication of charitable Aſſiſtances, that all the Members did afford each other, according to their ſeveral Wants and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities: For whether any Siſter-Church were under Perſecutions, or any particular Chriſtians did labour with Want, the other Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Body did Communicate to the Relief of either. And the Apoſtle did alſo appoint that to be done in the Chriſtian Aſſemblies, when they met together to Communicate in Hearing, Prayers, and Sacraments, ordering, that <hi>The firſt day of the Week,</hi> which was the Day of their Publick Aſſemblies, <hi>every one ſhould lay by him in ſtore, as God had proſpered him,</hi> to this Purpoſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. So that if <hi>One Member ſuffered, all the Members ſuffered with it, and there was no Schiſm in the Body, but the Members had the ſame care one of another,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.25, 26.</p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:151517:101"/>
                  <p>In a word: Such was the Communion, which the Members of the Church held with each other, in thoſe Days, which made it one Church, that there was no ſuch thing as any ſeparate Meetings, from thoſe of the Apoſtles, and their lawful Succeſſors, the Biſhops and Paſtors of the Flock, ſet up under the Pretence of better Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and for more pure Adminiſtrations of Ordinances. No, no ſooner did any attempt to make ſuch a Schiſm, but he was account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Gangreen'd Member, and cut off from the Body for ſo doing. And ſo much was mutual Kindneſs and Charity to be the diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Character of Chriſt's Church, that our Saviour declar'd, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.35. <hi>That by this ſhould all men know his Diſciples, that they had love one for another.</hi>

And ſuch a Head is Chriſt in that Spiritual Kingdom, the Church of God, <hi>Whom the Father having Raiſed from the Dead, did put all things under his Feet, and gave him to be Head over all things to the Church, which is his Body,</hi> Eph. 1.20, 21, 22, 23. And therefore purſuant to this Power, which was <hi>Given him in Heaven, and in Earth,</hi> to give Laws to Mankind, did he Commiſſion his Diſciples, and ſend them forth into the World, to Proclaim his Laws, to <hi>Teach all Nations, Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt; Teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever he had Commanded them;</hi> aſſuring them withal, that <hi>Lo he would be with them always, even unto the End of the World,</hi> Matth. 28.18, 19, 20. that is, That he would be ever with 'em, to Head and Protect 'em againſt their Adverſaries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is alſo a <hi>Domeſtick Head, viz.</hi> the <hi>Husband, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Wife; and ſo likewiſe is Christ the Head of the Church, and he is the Saviour of the Body,</hi> Eph. 5.23.

                  <p>And thus I have at length ſufficiently, in order to my Deſign of Explaining this Article, <hi>Wherein I was made a Member of Chriſt,</hi> ſhew'd
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:151517:101"/> you, <hi>What kind of Body the Church of Chriſt is.</hi> And, by the By, from what has been ſaid, it does appear, That the Church of Chriſt is a Spiritual Kingdom, put up in the World by God,<note place="margin">The Church of Christ, a Spiritual Kingdom.</note> on purpoſe to reduce Man to his due Allegiance to his Maker, and to deſtroy the Dominion of Satan, which he had ſo long Uſurpt over Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. It is a Kingdom, as it conſiſts of inferior Governours and Subjects, combin'd together, by ſpecial Laws of Allegiance, to the Sovereign King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and by Priviledges granted, by that Supreme Head and Governour, to ſuch his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and therefore it is ſo often, in the Scripture, call'd a <hi>Kingdom:</hi> But you ſee withal, it is a Spiritual Kingdom, by the Nature and Deſign of which, God is to Rule in the Hearts and Spirits of Men, and therefore it is, all over the New Teſtament, call'd the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt;</hi> For Chriſt does Reign and Rule therein by his Goſpel, as the Laws of that Kingdom, over the Spirits of Men; and thoſe are the People, or Subjects of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who own him for their King, and his Goſpel for the Laws of this Kingdom; and who do give themſelves up wholly, both Body, Soul and Spirit to be Governed by thoſe Laws.</p>
                  <p>And the Church is alſo often call'd in the Holy Scripture, the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> for indeed it is not a Kingdom of this World, ſupported with outward State, and armed Forces, in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, and to ſecure from thoſe who would Invade 'em, our tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Intereſts; <hi>If my Kingdom were of this World, then would my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants fight, that I ſhould not be deliver'd to the Jews,</hi> Joh. 18.36. but it is a Kingdom, or Society of Men, aſſociated together, and Liſted to Fight under Chriſt, the <hi>Great Captain of our Salvation,</hi> againſt much more formidable Enemies, than any Earthly Potentates; <hi>Even againſt Principalities and Powers, againſt the Rulers of the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this World, againſt ſpiritual Wickedneſs in high Places,</hi> Eph. 6.12. that is, againſt the Devil, and his wicked Angels, who would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoil us of our Heavenly Inheritance. Liſted, I ſay, to fight under Jeſus Chriſt, the Great Captain of our Salvation, for ſo he is call'd <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10. and to our Comfort, who are to fight under him, he has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready <hi>Spoiled theſe Principalities and Powers, and has made a ſhew of them openly upon the Croſs, triumphing over them in it,</hi> Col. 2.15. So that our Work is in a great meaſure already done under his Conduct, for he himſelf has diveſted the Devils of much of their Power, he has thrown 'em out of their Temples, ſilenc'd their Oracles, and does daily, by his Aſſiſtances, enable us to Foil 'em. So that the Church of Chriſt, you ſee, is a Spiritual Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>But yet notwithſtanding, that this Society, the Church,<note place="margin">But yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding a Viſible So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</note> is a <hi>Spiritual Kingdom,</hi> both as its Laws are Spiritual, reaching to the Government of the Inward Man; and alſo, as it is a Body Liſted under a Spiritual King, to fight againſt Spiritual Enemies: Yet however, from what has been ſaid, it does appear, that the Church, or Kingdom of Chriſt, is a <hi>Viſible Society</hi> of Men, conſiſting of ſuch who make an Outward and Viſible Profeſſion of Allegiance to Chriſt, having viſibly, by an Outward Sacrament, Enter'd into Covenant with him, and being ſuch as do viſibly Communicate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in his Holy Ordinances. And therefore it is not only of ſuch who by an inward, real, and true Faith are United to Chriſt, that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:151517:102"/> the Church and Kingdom of God, in this World, does conſiſt, but of all thoſe outward Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, who, by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſm, have Enter'd into Covenant with God. Such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as beſides an outward Covenanting, (which is certainly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary) are Renew'd withal to the Image of God in Knowledge, Righteouſneſs, and true Holineſs, are the only Perſons of which the <hi>Inviſible Church,</hi> as it is call'd, does conſiſt in this World, theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps being meant by the <hi>Little Flock,</hi> Luk. 12.32. and of ſuch only will the whole Church, in the World to come, be made up, being, of <hi>The many that are Called, the few that are Choſen,</hi> Matth. 20.16. But if we conſider the Church of Chriſt in its fully Latitude, and in that imperfect State wherein it now is, on this ſide Heaven; many Hypocrites and bad Men, as well as truly ſincere and good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, do belong to it, for the Church of Chriſt, here on Earth, is compar'd, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.24, 25. to a <hi>Field,</hi> which contains <hi>Wheat and Tares growing up together,</hi> and to a <hi>Net,</hi> ver. 47. wherein there are <hi>Fiſh, both good and bad.</hi> Such you ſee is the Nature and Temper of that Body of Chriſt, his Church; concerning which I thought it requiſite to give you a more than ordinary full account, even in this place, before we come to the Article, <hi>I believe the Holy Catholick Church,</hi> becauſe that otherwiſe it cannot be ſo well apprehended.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">What it is to be a Member of Christ's Church.</note>Secondly, <hi>What it is to be a Member of Chriſt's Church;</hi> which now the way being ſo far clear'd, I ſhall in few words ſhew you. And from what has been ſaid it does eaſily now appear, that a true Member of the Church of Chriſt, is one who belongs to that Society of Chriſtians which conſiſts of Lawful Governours and Paſtors, and of the People of God committed to their Charge, the one Miniſtring in Holy Things, and the other Partaking thereof at their Hands. He is not a Member of that narrow and enclos'd Society of Worſhipers, the Jewiſh Synagogue, who by their peculiar Rites and Ways of Worſhip, were confin'd to one Nation and Place, no more than he is one of the Gentile World at large; but he is One, who either himſelf was call'd, or is deſcended of thoſe who were call'd, from out of the wicked World of Jews and Gentiles, to a Holy Profeſſion and Calling, <hi>viz.</hi> To the Belief of the One True God, Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt; as alſo to Repentance from dead Works, to ſerve him the only Living and True God. And he is call'd, as to Faith and Repentance, ſo to enjoy the Priviledges of the Goſpel, and the Rewards of ſuch Faith and Repentance; namely, Moſt Reaſonable and Excellent Laws and Ordinances, to conduct him to Heaven, with a plentiful meaſure of Divine Grace and Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance alſo, convey'd by thoſe Ordinances, to enable him to Obey thoſe Laws; and he is One, who to the End of being of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Men, the Chriſtian Church, and of having God a Friend to him, and he himſelf a Servant of God's, has ſolemnly Enter'd into Covenant with God in his Baptiſm, and continues often to Renew the ſame in the Lord's Supper, becauſe the Divine Goodneſs does in both Vouchſafe to make over and enſure to him thoſe exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Great and Invaluable Priviledges, and moſt ſingular Benefits, as well as he on the other ſide, does ſolemnly Engage to yield himſelf up to the Service and Obedience of God. Farther yet, a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:151517:102"/> of Chriſt's Church is one, who is not only United to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church in and by one Covenant, that is, in the Profeſſion of the ſame Faith and Repentance, and in the Enjoyment of the ſame Priviledges, and in the uſe of the ſame Sacraments. But alſo he maintains this Union therewith, by <hi>Communicating</hi> with that particular Part of the Catholick Church where he lives, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is a Member in particular; by communicating, I ſay, therewith in Hearing, together with the reſt of the Body, the ſame Doctrine, in Joyning in the ſame Common-Prayers, and receiving the ſame Holy Sacraments; and Laſtly, in Receiving from, and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring mutual Aſſiſtances to the Members of that Body, where-ever diſpers'd, or however diſtreſs'd over the Face of the whole World, as there ſhall be occaſion. And Laſtly, a Member of Chriſt's Church is One, who belongs to that univerſal Society of Men, call'd out of the World, to ſuch Duties and Priviledges, as has been ſpoke, and is united into one Body, by the ſame means, as has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, under Jeſus Chriſt its ſupreme Head. And if you conſider him as a Member of the Kingdom of Chriſt, he is one who is <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by God from the power of Darkneſs, and is tranſlated into the Kingdom of his dear Son,</hi> Col. 1.13. that is, he is one of thoſe, who is deliver'd by the Goſpel, from under the Tyranny of Satan, under which the whole World was held Captive, and is made a Subject to the Gracious Government of the Son of God. From what has been ſaid, it does plainly appear, I think, that ſuch, and ſuch a One only, is a true Member of Chriſt's Church.</p>
                  <p>And in the Sence of your Catechiſm, which teaches all to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That in their Baptiſm they are made <hi>Members of Chriſt;</hi> every Perſon who has been admitted into the Church by Baptiſm, is a Member of Chriſt, and ſhall continue ſuch till he is cut off by the juſt Sentence of thoſe Governours in the Church, who have the <hi>Power of the Keys,</hi> to Receive in, or Shut out; or till he cuts off himſelf from that myſtical Body, by a <hi>cauſleſs Schiſm and Separation</hi> from any of its ſound Parts.</p>
                  <p>Every Baptized Perſon, I ſay, is a Member of the Viſible Church.<note place="margin">Every Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Perſon is a Member of the Viſible Church.</note> So the Apoſtle expreſly ſpeaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. aſſuring us, that <hi>As many as have been Baptized into Chriſt,</hi> that is, the Chriſtian Church, <hi>have put on Chriſt,</hi> or have put on that Relation to Chriſt that Members have to the Body. True it is, amongſt thoſe, that are Incorporated by Baptiſm into the Church, many do prove but very unſound and unfruitful Members; ſuch as, tho' they are admitted into that Holy Society, in order to their Edification, and through Converſion, by the means of thoſe Holy Ordinances, which Chriſt has appointed in his Church, do yet continue to be very bad Men, both in their Principles and Practices. Hence it is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.10. that of thoſe who were called into the Wedding, that is, the Church, by the Servants or Officers of the Bridegroom, that is, Chriſt, there are as well <hi>Bad as Good.</hi> Yet as appears from that, and many the like Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables of our Saviour, concerning the Materials and Conſtitution of his Church, even ſuch bad Men, when once Baptized into it, are Members of it.</p>
                  <p>And ſhall continue to be Members of it,<note place="margin">And ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſuch, till cut of by the juſt Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of thoſe, who have the Power of the Keys, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in, or Shut out.</note> till ſuch time as they are cut off by the juſt Sentence of thoſe who have the Power of the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:151517:103"/> Keys, to Receive in, or Shut out. For this you are to know, that Chriſt has given his Apoſtles, and their Succeſſors in the Government of the Church, a <hi>Church Authority,</hi> conſiſting in <hi>Receiving in,</hi> or <hi>Shutting out of the Church. To Receive into the Church,</hi> is to Admit ſuch as make a Profeſſion of Chriſtianity; to Admit 'em, I ſay, by the Sacrament of Baptiſm, to all the outward Acts of Communion. <hi>To ſhut, or caſt out of the Church,</hi> is by Excommunication to Exclude unworthy Perſons from that Priviledge of Church-Communion, to deny 'em the Liberty to Pray, or Receive the Sacrament, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any Religious Office in the Publick Aſſemblies of the Church. And now accordingly has Chriſt appointed the Biſhops and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of his Church, to be as Shepherds to <hi>Overſee the Flock,</hi> as you will find, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. and has given 'em <hi>The Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Matth. 16.19. that is, Authority, as to Admit into the Church, by <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> all who make a Profeſſion of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; ſo to Expel out of it, by <hi>Excommunication,</hi> all thoſe ſcabbed Members thereof, who contrary to ſuch their Holy Profeſſion, either by their peſtilent Hereſies, or by their ſcandalous Ill Lives, are Unworthy of it, and in danger to Infect it. If they Preach, or any-wiſe propagate any peſtilent Hereſy, contrary to the Fundamental Truths of Chriſtianity, let their Perſons be never ſo acceptable, upon the account of ſome ſhining Vertues of Charity, or their Doctrines never ſo Plauſible, as pretending to Reaſon, they ought not to be ſpared. <hi>Tho' we, or an Angel from Heaven, preach any other Goſpel unto you, than that which we have preached unto you, let him be Accurſed;</hi> that is, Excommunicated, and cut off from Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. So far was this Bleſſed Apoſtle, ſo Zealous for the Glory of his Saviour, from ſparing others, that he would not have himſelf be ſuffer'd to continue in the Communion of the Church, were it poſſible he ſhould be guilty of propagating Hereſy: And ſo likewiſe is any Perſon, guilty of a notorious and ſcandalous Ill Life. Why then alſo are the Governours of Chriſt's Church commanded, To <hi>put away from 'em that wicked perſon,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.13? And all the Members of the myſtical Body, are ſo far bound to take notice of ſuch an <hi>Excommunication,</hi> as to diſown and diſcard ſuch a Perſon, and to have no Society with him, ſo 1 <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 5.11. <hi>If any Man that is called a Brother, be a Fornicator, or Covetous, or an Idolater, or a Railer, or a Drunkard, or an Extortioner, with ſuch a one,</hi> after Excommunication, <hi>they were not to Eat.</hi> In ſuch Caſes as theſe, indeed, an Evil Member becomes no Member, and is to be to the reſt as a Heathen Man, and a Publican, that is, One that is out of the Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17.</p>
                  <p>And ſo likewiſe is he, who cuts himſelf off from that myſtical Body the Church, by a cauſleſs Schiſm, and Separation from any of its ſound Parts.<note place="margin">Or till he cuts himſelf off, by a cauſleſs Schiſm and Separation, from any of its ſound Parts.</note> I ſay, any of its ſound Parts, for where-ever there is a true Church, if there be nothing in its Doctrine nor Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that is ſinful, every Perſon is bound to <hi>Continue ſtedfaſtly in the Doctrine, Prayers, and Sacraments, and Fellowſhip</hi> of that Church, as in the Apoſtle's times they did, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. and to reject the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of all other Parties and Sects of Chriſtians, or otherwiſe he will cut off himſelf from the Church, and will ceaſe to be a real Member of it, as the Finger ceaſes to be of the Body, when it is
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:151517:103"/> cut off from the Arm. Thus in either of theſe Caſes, indeed, ſhall a Perſon diſcontinue to be a <hi>Member</hi> of Chriſt's Church; when either he is Cut off, by the juſt Sentence of thoſe Governours in the Church, who have the <hi>Power of the Keys,</hi> to <hi>Receive in,</hi> or <hi>Shut out,</hi> or when he Cuts himſelf off by a <hi>cauſleſs Separation and Schiſm,</hi> from any of its ſound Parts.</p>
                  <p>But otherwiſe, all Perſons who have Enter'd into Covenant with God, and have been Admitted into it by Baptiſm, are Members of Chriſt's Church, (as has been already ſufficiently prov'd, and need not again be repeated:) And ſo ſhall Partake of thoſe exceeding great Priviledges, which belong to the Members of it; which what, and how great they are, I come next to declare unto you.</p>

                  <p>BY the Church of Chriſt, as has been ſhew'd, is meant a <hi>Viſible Society</hi> of Men, call'd forth of the World, to the Knowledge, Belief and Service of the One True God, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and Profeſſing the ſame in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Service of Satan, and all falſe Gods what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, and alſo to all thoſe vicious and immoral Practices, which did ſo notoriouſly accompany the Pagan Worſhip; and indeed profeſſing an utter Hatred to all Sin, of any kind. And it is a Society, as has been ſhew'd you, combin'd into one Covenant with God, by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sacraments, and holding Communion with each other, under Jeſus Chriſt its Head.</p>
                  <p>And a Member of Chriſt's Church, you have alſo ſeen, is every One, who has been Enter'd into this viſible Society of Holy Men, and into this Covenant with God, by Baptiſm, and who holds a conſtant Communion, without ſwerving aſide into ſeparate Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, with that Particular, True, and Orthodox Church, whereof he is a Member, and in whoſe Verge he lives. Every ſuch Perſon, I have ſhew'd you, is a Member of Chriſt's Church, and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſuch, except his Lawful Governours therein, ſhould cut him off by a juſt Excommunication, or he ſhould cut off himſelf by a ſinful and unneceſſary Separation.</p>
                  <p>And now having ſufficiently made it appear, in the former Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to this purpoſe, Firſt, what kind of Body that is, which is call'd the Church of Chriſt, and alſo, Secondly, having ſhew'd you, what it is to be a Member of it; it will be now requiſite, that I ſhould alſo Demonſtrate to you, (in order to make you ſufficiently ſenſible of which, the Two former Points have been ſo largely treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of) Thirdly, what vaſt and invaluable <hi>Priviledges</hi> do accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly belong to every Member of Chriſt's viſible Church. I ſay, to <hi>Every Member of Chriſt's viſible Church,</hi> for it is not my Buſineſs here to Enlarge on the more peculiar Priviledges of thoſe, who are ſtyl'd Members of the <hi>Inviſible Church,</hi> who are the ſincere Part only of Chriſt's viſible Church. Thoſe perhaps, I may alſo declare in few words by the By. But the Priviledges, which I am here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to Treat upon, and to Acquaint you with, are ſuch as belong to every Member of the Church I have been ſpeaking of.</p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:151517:104"/>
                  <p>And theſe Priviledges,<note place="margin">The Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of our being Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſts Church.</note> which do peculiarly belong to all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt's Church, as they are the Members of ſuch a Body whereof he is the Head, are theſe Two: Firſt, a moſt reaſonable and excellent Body of Religion and Laws, together with moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and edifying Inſtitutions and Ordinances, appointed by Him, our ſupreme Head and Governour, to conduct us to Heaven. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, a ſufficient meaſure of Divine Grace and Aſſiſtance, deriv'd down upon us, from Him our myſtical Head, and convey'd by thoſe his Ordinances, to Enable us to conform to his Religion, and Obey thoſe Laws.</p>
                  <p>And the firſt great <hi>Priviledge,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> A moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Body of Religion, Laws, and Ordinances.</note> which does peculiarly belong to all the Members of Chriſt's viſible Church, as they are the Members of ſuch a Society, <hi>Is a moſt reaſonable and excellent Body of Religion and Laws, together with moſt profitable and edifying Inſtitutions and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, given and appointed us by him our ſupreme Head and Governour, to Conduct us to Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We do enjoy, I ſay, thereby,<note place="margin">The Chriſtian Religion, and Laws, far exceed the Pagan, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan, or Jewiſh.</note> 
                     <hi>The Priviledge of a moſt reaſonable and excellent Body of Religion and Laws, far exceeding what any other People have ever enjoy'd, to Conduct us to Heaven.</hi> This is clearly to be ſeen, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.8, 9, 10, 11. where God himſelf finding Fault with the Jewiſh Covenant and Laws, as what <hi>could not make the Comers thereunto perfect,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Behold, the days come, when I will make a new Covenant with the houſe of Iſrael, and with the houſe of Judah; not according to the Covenant, that I made with their Fathers, in the day when I took them by the hand, to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for this is the Covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael after thoſe days, ſaith the Lord, I will put my Laws into their Minds, and write them in their Hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And they ſhall not teach every man his Neighbour, and every man his Brother, ſaying, Know the Lord, for all ſhall know me from the leaſt to the greateſt;</hi> which remarkable Words, ſpoke firſt by the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> as a Prophecy of the moſt happy State of the Chriſtian Church, by reaſon of the moſt excellent Covenant and Laws that would be given it, beyond what was the State of the Jewiſh, do import, that even the Jewiſh Covenant was not in it ſelf Perfect, and ſuch as could not be better'd and improv'd, tho' it had God for its Author; (and ſure then thoſe Superſtitions, which derive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from no better Authors than the Devil, and wicked Impoſtors, muſt be very bad) but that the Chriſtian Covenant, and Laws have ſuch an inward, eſſential Goodneſs in them, that a Man's own Reaſon would prompt him to approve 'em as Beſt, and moſt Excellent; there being none of its Doctrines, but what are highly agreeable to the beſt Reaſon of Man, and all its Precepts being no other, than the Law written in every Man's own Heart.</p>
                  <p>And indeed the Chriſtian Religion, whether we conſider it, as compar'd with the Pagan, or Mahometan Superſtition, and Jewiſh Diſpenſation, or in its own Nature, it is a moſt ſingular Inſtitution, and Body of Laws, and ſuch as we ought to Eſteem it our very great Happineſs and Advantage, above other Men, that we are under the Government of 'em.</p>
                  <p>And Firſt, conſider the whole Body of the <hi>Pagan Superſtition,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Pagan Superſtition tended to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but to defile humane Nature.</note> and what elſe did it tend to, but to debaſe Mankind infinitely below
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:151517:105"/> the Dignity of their Nature, and to defile 'em much more than the very Brutes. The Gods, which the Pagans worſhip, were at beſt the moſt Vile and Infamous of Humane Race, <hi>viz.</hi> An Adulterous <hi>Jupiter,</hi> a Revengeful <hi>Juno,</hi> a Drunken <hi>Bacchus,</hi> a Wanton <hi>Venus,</hi> a Thieviſh <hi>Mercury,</hi> and a Cruel <hi>Mars</hi> (not to mention how they Bowed themſelves before, and gave Divine Worſhip to the moſt poor and contemptible,<note place="margin">The Gods the Pagans worſhiped, were, at beſt, the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Men and Women.</note> ſenſeleſs Creatures.) And when they Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip'd Adulterers, and Whores, and Thieves, and Drunkards, what can be expected but that the Rites whereby they ſerved 'em ſhould be accompany'd with the vileſt Practices, ſuch as were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the Nature and Temper of ſuch Deities? Which was the occaſion of thoſe Words of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Epiſt. 4.3. telling thoſe, who had been lately Converted from Paganiſm to Chriſtianity, that <hi>The time paſt of their lives was ſufficient to have wrought the Will of the Gentiles, when they walked in Laſciviouſneſs, Luſts, Exceſs of Wine, Revellings, Banquetings, and abominable Idolatries;</hi> wherein is more than intimated, that the Idolatries of the Heathens were uſually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd with ſuch villanous Practices. And indeed from the Pagan Authors themſelves we know they were ſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Many times they worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the very Devils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note>But it was not only the vileſt of Men and Women, but the Devils themſelves, whom the Pagans worſhip'd, and whom they were wont to ſerve, not only with abominable Idolatries, accompany'd with moſt lewd Practices (which however hateful to right Reaſon, might be grateful to ſome ſenſual Spirits) but they were forc'd to commit many times the greateſt Violences poſſible to Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in their Worſhip to thoſe barbarous and cruel Devils, they A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd.<note place="margin">And that with lewd, barbarous, and cruel Rites.</note> Thus it was the manner of the <hi>Worſhipers of Baal to cut themſelves with Knives, and Lancers till the Blood guſhed out upon them,</hi> 1 King. 18.28. Nay, <hi>The ſacrificed their Sons and their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters unto Devils, and ſhed innocent Blood, even the blood of their Sons and of their Daughters, whom they ſacrificed unto the Idols of Canaan,</hi> Pſal. 106.37, 38. Which was a Barbarity ſo horrid to Humane Nature, that they were forc'd to make uſe of loud Inſtruments, at the time of Sacrifice, to drown the Noiſe of the ſhrieking Infants. And at this day the Idol <hi>Vitſiputſi</hi> amongſt the <hi>Indians,</hi> is ſaid to have many Thouſands ſlain in one of his ſolemn Proceſſions, it being uſual for his Worſhipers to throw themſelves under the Wheels of his Maſſy Chariot, on purpoſe to be cruſh'd in Pieces, by the Weight thereof going over 'em. Such are the lewd and barbarous Rites of the Pagan Religion, not to mention any thing of thoſe intolerable ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh Fears, which always poſſeſs Idolatrous and Superſtitious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligioniſts, who are always in dread, leſt they ſhould Incenſe the angry and peeviſh <hi>Daemon,</hi> by every little Accident, and are ever upon the Rack, ſtudying to pleaſe him by innumerable little inſignificant Obſervances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is a vile Impoſture.</note>Nor Secondly, As to the <hi>Mahometan Religion,</hi> is there any thing in it worthy of God, whereby we ſhould judge him to be its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. Firſt, it is a plain Impoſture and Cheat, pretending to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd by God, to his Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> after the Jewiſh and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, as a more perfect Inſtitution than either, whereas, indeed, look into the whole Matter, and inward Frame thereof, and we ſhall find nothing in it, as One obſerves, but <q>A Maſs of fooliſh
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:151517:105"/> Opinions, odd Stories, uncouth Ceremonies, compounded chiefly of the Dregs of Chriſtian Hereſies, together with ſome Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients of Judaiſm and Paganiſm, confuſedly jumbled, or unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully mixt one with the other.</q> But as to that great Principle of it, which promiſes in Paradiſe a Thouſand Years ſatisfaction, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from ſenſual Pleaſures, and the Enjoyment of Women, to thoſe, who ſhall ſlay the Unbelievers, that is, Chriſtians; (for ſo they do call us eſpecially, becauſe we believe not in their <hi>Mahomet.</hi>) This one Principle of their Religion, I ſay, is enough to debauch Humane Nature to the loweſt Degree of Naughtineſs, by giving Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Two worſt of Sins, Luſt, and Cruelty;<note place="margin">Its Principles tend to Luſt and Cruelty.</note> and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Effects of it are, That they give an unbounded Range to their Luſts amongſt themſelves, and are Cruel and Blood-thirſty to all the World beſides, being Inſtigated by their very Religion, to fill the whole Earth with War, Deſolations and Miſery; ſo that this is another Religion alſo, which Tends, inſtead of Improving, to deprave Humane Nature, and to make it much worſe.</p>
                  <p>And Thirdly, As to the Jewiſh Religion,<note place="margin">Judaiſm was an imperfect and unfiniſht Draught of Religion.</note> tho' that indeed was of a Divine Original, yet whether it were, that the Infancy of the World was not ripe for a more deep and manly Inſtruction; or whether that particular Nation however, to whoſe Diſpoſition and Capacity thoſe Laws and Conſtitutions were ſuited, was unfit for the higheſt and hardeſt Leſſons; ſo it was, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls their Ordinances, <hi>Poor and Beggarly Elements,</hi> Gal. 4.9.3. And indeed as to the Ritual Part of their Law, the Ceremonies and Sacrifices thereof, were for the moſt part Types and <hi>Shadows of good things to come,</hi> Heb. 10.1. And as to the Moral Part, <hi>Moſes for the hardneſs of their Hearts,</hi> was forc'd to Indulge 'em, what the Perfection and Purity of the Chriſtian Religion, will by no means allow of, as may be ſeen in the Caſe of <hi>Putting away a Wife for every Cauſe,</hi> Luke 19.8. But above all, it is to be conſidered, that univerſal Love and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to Enemies, to all Mankind, of what Nation and Religion ſoever they be, which does ſo nearly reſemble us to God himſelf, <hi>Who maketh his Sun to riſe on the Evil, and on the Good,</hi> Matth. 5.45. was as it were a <hi>New Commandment to them,</hi> Joh. 13.34. And yet ſuch an unbounded Charity and Kindneſs, as this, is the great and neceſſary Duty of Chriſtianity. So that Judaiſm at the beſt, and before that it was Corrupted by the falſe Interpretations put upon the Law, by the Scribes and Phariſees, was but an imperfect Draught of Religion, begun by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but left to be finiſhed by the more perfect Stroaks of our Saviour's Pencil afterwards, who is therefore ſaid to have <hi>Come, not to deſtroy the Law or the Prophets, but to fill 'em up,</hi> Matth. 5.17. Thus Imperfect at beſt, was the Jewiſh Law. But now conſider</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The whole Body of that Religion,<note place="margin">Christianity a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Religion.</note> which Chriſt our ſupreme Head and Governour has given us, and under whoſe Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance we have the Happineſs to be, as we are the <hi>Members of Chriſt's Church,</hi> and nothing can repreſent God in more Noble Characters, and Glorious Perfections; nothing can give a more Honourable and Rational Account of his Proceedings with Man, both in his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and Redemption of him, than it does. And as his Laws are infinitely beyond what the Wiſdom of any Humane Law-givers
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:151517:106"/> did ever yet contrive for the good Order of Man in this World, and his real Happineſs both in this, and the World to come; ſo no Motives, nor Reaſons can poſſibly be more Powerful, than thoſe which Chriſtianity does give us, to Obey thoſe Laws.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">It gives a moſt excellent Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God.</note>As to the Nature of God, Chriſtianity does plainly repreſent him as a Being, that has no manner of Imperfection in his Nature, but as One, that is adorn'd with all the moſt glorious Attributes, and higheſt Perfections poſſible. It repreſents him to us ſo infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wiſe, Juſt and Holy, and yet ſo wonderfully beyond all Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon Good and Merciful; and to add to all this, ſo intimately Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to all we ſay, or do, ſo Omniſcient in diſcerning the very Thoughts and Intents of our Hearts, and withal ſo abſolutely Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful in doing whatſoever he pleaſes in Heaven, and in Earth, that <hi>Shall not this his Excellency make us afraid?</hi> Job 13.11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">It gives an Honourable account of his Proceedings with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference both to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of us.</note>And then as to his Proceedings with Man, both in his Creation and Redemption of him. Chriſtianity gives us the moſt plain and rational account thereof in the World. It gives us to know how that God made man Upright, and being ſo, we were at perfect A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with him; but that afterwards we fell by Tranſgreſſion from him, and muſt have ſuffered the Doom of Rebels for ſo doing. It lets us then know, That God taking Pity of us in this miſerable Caſe, ſent his own Son to Preach Repentance, and to offer Terms of Reconciliation to us. And moreover, becauſe it was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with God's Holineſs, nor with his Wiſdom and Juſtice, as Governour of the World, to let Sin go unpuniſh't, or to accept of a Sacrifice and Satisfaction leſs infinite in <hi>Value,</hi> than he was in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> who was Offended, that he therefore gave this his only Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son alſo to Dye for us, and accepted of his infinitely meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Sufferings here, inſtead of our ſuffering Eternally hereafter; and as a ſufficient Satisfaction to his injur'd Juſtice, which we in our own Perſons could not pay, without periſhing Everlaſtingly. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity does withal Reveal to us, that this our High-Prieſt, after having Offer'd himſelf for us here on Earth, a Sacrifice for our Sins, he is now gone into Heaven, to Intercede with the Father, in the merit thereof, that it may be accepted to the Pardon of 'em. And it alſo informs us, that being aſcended to his Father, which is in Heaven, in order fully to reconcile him to Man, he has ſubſtituted his Holy Spirit here on Earth, to perfect the Reconciliation and Conformity of our Natures to God, by moving and moulding our Hearts to true Repentance, and Faith in him.</p>
                  <p>This is in ſhort, that account which Chriſtianity gives us, both of our Creation, and of our Redemption. And ſo every way Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional it is in it ſelf, and ſo exceedingly agreeable to the wiſeſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Government in the World, that tho' it was beyond the reach of our Reaſons, before this whole Myſtery of Redemption was reveal'd to us in the Goſpel, to think of ſuch an extraordinary way for our Recovery out of a loſt and undone Condition, and of Reconciliation to God; yet now ſince it is revealed, all the reaſon of Mankind, whoſe <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings the God of this world hath not blinded,</hi> muſt own, that there is no method of Proceeding in ſuch a Caſe, could be more worthy of the Holineſs, Juſtice, Mercy and Wiſdom of God, nor ſo likely to work Repentance in Man, not
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:151517:106"/> conſequently more agreeable to the wiſe Governour of the World to take, than this. So agreeable to the beſt improved Reaſon of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, are the Doctrinal, and even the moſt myſterious Parts of the Chriſtian Religion; that Religion, which it is our Happineſs, as we are Members of Chriſt's Church, to be under the direction of.</p>
                  <p>Nor can any thing be better contriv'd for the Happineſs of Men,<note place="margin">Its Laws are excellently contrived for the good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</note> with relation to themſelves, or others, than what the Laws of our Saviour do directly tend to. As to our ſelves, they do ſo powerfully tend to mortify our Luſts and Appetites, thoſe Rebels to our own Reaſon; to moderate our Paſſions and Affections, which ſo violently rack and diſturb our own Breaſts; and they are excellently fitted alſo, to make us ſo Humble and Self-denying, ſo Temperate and Sober, ſo Chaſt and Pure, as Men on Earth would appear to be Angels come from Heaven, were the Laws of Chriſt univerſally followed. And laſtly as to Others, ſuch Juſtice and Uprightneſs, ſuch Charity and Kindneſs, ſuch Quiet and Peaceableneſs, does Chriſtianity incline men to, (upon which account the State of the Goſpel is repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as that, <hi>In which nothing ſhould deſtroy, nor hurt in the holy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> Iſa. 11.9.) And let me alſo add, ſuch Prudent and Fatherly Care of Children, Servants and Dependants, do the Laws of Chriſt preſcribe, as would make a Heaven here upon Earth, were they univerſally Obey'd. I ſay, were they univerſally Obey'd.</p>
                  <p>And yet to add to all this Excellency of Chriſt's Government and Laws over us; already ſeen,<note place="margin">And are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd by moſt powerful Principles &amp; Motives.</note> ſo powerfully is our Obedience to all theſe Laws Enforc'd by thoſe mighty Principles and Motives of Chriſtianity, <hi>viz.</hi> The Articles of our Chriſtian Faith; I mean, ſo very Perſwaſive and Forcible are the Motives, which Chriſt does give us to the Practice of theſe Vertues, beyond what was in any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Motives, which the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> or even <hi>Moſes</hi> did give, the Gentiles, or the Jews, to be in any degree Vertuous, that this is another addition to our Advantage, in having Chriſt for our <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Head</hi> and Law-giver, and in being <hi>Members of Chriſt's Church.</hi> In a word, ſo Honourable to God, ſo Perfective of our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſo Beneficial to Mankind are the Laws of Chriſt, and ſo well is our Obedience ſecur'd to 'em, by thoſe Principles he has taught us, that this very Thing does ſpeak our exceeding Great Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, in being Members of Chriſt, and under his Conduct and Government, as our ſupreme Head and Law-giver.</p>
                  <p>But eſpecially this Advantage will appear to be very Great,<note place="margin">Another Branch of this firſt part of a a Chriſtian's Priviledge, are moſt edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions and Ordinances.</note> if we conſider, <hi>How that together with thoſe moſt excellent Laws, that he has given us, he has alſo appointed us moſt Edifying and comfortable Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, to Conduct us to Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now by Divine <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> I do mean thoſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Appointments and Obſervations, which he has given his Church, and all the Members thereof, for their Improvement in the Knowledge and Practice of his Holy Religion and Laws. And that which our Great Law-giver has done of this Nature, is this; He has Ordain'd ſolemn and ſet Days, <hi>viz.</hi> The Chriſtian Sabbaths, for his own Service; He has Order'd that Publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of all Chriſtians ſhould be held upon thoſe Days; he has Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriz'd and Commanded the Publication and Preaching of his Laws at thoſe Publick Aſſemblies; He has appointed that Common-Prayers,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:151517:107"/> Supplications and Thankſgivings, for Divine Grace and Aſſiſtance, to enable us to perform theſe Laws then Preacht, and for other Mercies, ſhould be jointly put up to him by all Chriſtians on thoſe ſolemn Days, and publick Aſſemblies; and Laſtly, he has En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd therein the uſe of Sacraments, as means of Conveying ſuch Grace and Aſſiſtance, and alſo as Oaths and Obligations upon us to be Obedient to thoſe Laws. All which are the Priviledges that do belong to the Members of Chriſt's <hi>Viſible Church.</hi> And if we compare 'em with what others want of this Nature, they are indeed moſt ſingular Favours, vouchſafed only to ſuch as are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof, and which <hi>Aliens and Strangers</hi> have no Right, nor Admittance to. And conſider'd in themſelves, they are moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Advantages towards the Obſervation of God's moſt Holy Laws, and in order to a Holy and Good Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> Publick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, the Priviledge of every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſts Church.</note>Firſt, I ſay, <hi>All theſe</hi> fore-mentioned <hi>Priviledges do belong to the Members of Chriſt's Church,</hi> to ſuch as have been Baptized, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs themſelves to be Chriſtians. To underſtand which Rights and Priviledges the better, you muſt know, that as there are <q>Two ſorts of Members in the viſible Church, ſo there are Two kinds of Priviledges that belong to each ſort, as One rightly ſtates this Matter, each having thoſe Priviledges, which are proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to 'em, according to the relation they bear to the Head, and their Fellow-Members.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <q>There are Members only by <hi>Foederal,</hi> or <hi>Covenant Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> ſuch are only Born of Water, when by Baptiſm they are United to Chriſt and the Church, and take upon them the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and Practice of the Chriſtian Religion. Now the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that do belong to theſe, are of the ſame make with their Church-Memberſhip, Outward, and conſiſt only in outward and publick Communion with the Church, in Word and Ordinances.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <q>There are <hi>Members by Real and Inherent Holineſs,</hi> ſuch as are, not only Born of Water, but of the Spirit alſo, when by the inward Operation of the Holy Ghoſt their Souls are Renew'd after the Image of God, and made Partakers of a Divine Nature. And the Priviledges that do belong to theſe, are not only the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Ones, but together with them, others that are ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their more ſpiritual Relations, Inward, and ſuch as conſiſt in the ſpecial and particular Care and Protection of God, and in the more plentiful Meaſures of his Grace, and in the more ſenſible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of his Holy Spirit, according to that of our Saviour, <bibl>

                  <p>But then, as to <hi>Outward Priviledges,</hi> it is not only the Duty, but it is the Priviledge, which of Right belongs to Every <hi>Member</hi> of Chriſt's Church, to Obſerve the Lord's Day, to be Preſent in the Publick Aſſemblies, to Join in the Common-Prayers, and even to Partake, when of Age, of the Lord's Supper, So we find, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41, 42. That the whole <hi>Three Thouſand Souls, who received the Word,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:151517:107"/> and were Baptized, continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtle's Doctrine and Fellowſhip, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>True it is, ſuch as that more than ordinary Regard,<note place="margin">Scandalous Members to be ſuſpended from the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</note> that the Church of Chriſt has for the Lord's Supper, that moſt ſolemn Ordinance in the Chriſtian Religion, that when any Member becomes Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous for any Sin, he is to be <hi>Suſpended from Communion in that, till he amends:</hi> So it is order'd in the <hi>Rubrick,</hi> before the <hi>Communion-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> that if any be an open and notorious Evil-Liver, ſo that the Congregation be thereby offended; The Curate, having Knowledge thereof, ſhall Call him, and Advertiſe him, that in any-wiſe he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume not to come to the Lord's Table, until he hath openly declared himſelf to have truly Repented, and Amended his former Naughty Life, that the Congregation may thereby be ſatisfy'd, which before were Offended. And the ſame Order ſhall the Curate uſe with thoſe, betwixt whom he perceiveth Malice and Hatred to reign, not ſuffering them to be Partakers at the Lord's Table, till he Knows them to be Reconciled. But otherwiſe, till a Member become No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and Scandalous for his Evil Principles, or Practices, he may claim the <hi>Right</hi> to be admitted to the Lord's Supper; for even <hi>Judas</hi> himſelf, before he Betray'd our Saviour, did Partake with him at the firſt Inſtitution of the Supper, as you will find, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.25, 26. So that as to the Outward Inſtitutions and Ordinances of Chriſt, they are Priviledges, you ſee, that do belong to all the Members of Chriſt's Church, to all ſuch as have been Baptized, and Profeſs themſelves to be Chriſtians. And now</p>

                        <hi>I.</hi> Chriſtian Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances are a ſingular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, which Aliens and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers do not, nor have any Right to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy.</note> 
                     <hi>If we compare but theſe outward Priviledges of God's Holy Ordinances, with what others do want of this Nature, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed moſt ſingular Favours, vouchſafed only to ſuch as are Members of Chriſt's Church, and which Aliens and Strangers have no Right, nor Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance to.</hi> For alas!

They neither Know the Lord's Day, nor Hold any Aſſemblies thereon for the Inſtruction in his Laws; neither do they Profeſs Belief in, nor Pray to the One True God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; and they are utter Strangers to our Holy Myſteries. And hence it comes to paſs, that thoſe miſerable People continue ſtill in Blindneſs, Ignorance and Barbarity; remain perfect Slaves to Satan, and their own Brutiſh Luſts, and for the moſt part of 'em, are degenerated into ſuch Inhumanity, Cruelty, and Brutality, that Tygers, Wolves, and Vipers, the moſt Devouring and Venemous Creatures in the World, are not ſo miſchievous to Mankind, as that Part thereof, who either know not, or contemn God's Holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, are one to another: So true it is, what <hi>Solomon</hi> has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.18. that <hi>Where there is no Viſion,</hi> or no Word and Ordinances of Divine Revelation, <hi>the People periſh.</hi> Which brings me</p>

In theſe Holy Ordinances we have all the Means both Outward, and Inward, afforded for our Converſion. As to the Outward, you have the very Scriptures themſelves, the Body of thoſe Holy Laws, publickly Proclaim'd and Read out to you; the Scripture it ſelf, I ſay, <hi>Which was given by Inſpiration of God, and is profitable for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs, that the Man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good works,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16, 17. In theſe Holy Ordinances again, you are not left to the Deceits and Whiſpers of a private Spirit, but you have the Doctrine of the Church, collected into a <hi>Form of ſound words,</hi> and containing all that is neceſſary, whether as to <hi>Faith,</hi> or that <hi>Love which is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> or which is required in the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. You have this Collected, I ſay, partly by the Apoſtles themſelves, and partly by others, the wiſeſt and beſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, out of the Holy Scriptures, and propos'd to you as a Rule to walk by: And moreover you have the Miniſters of Chriſt, conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applying both to your direction: The Miniſters of Chriſt, I ſay, who as his <hi>Ambaſſadors do Pray you in Chriſt's ſtead to be Reconciled to God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.20. Again, In theſe Holy Ordinances, you do not wreſtle with God for his Mercies, in the ſtrength only of your own private Prayers, but you have your Devotions mingled with the concurrent Prayers of all God's People, and ſo by your joint Forces, after an humble, but powerful manner, do Beſiege Heaven; for the <hi>joint and united Prayers</hi> of Chriſtians have, above all others, the Promiſe of a Gracious Anſwer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.20. Our Saviour aſſuring us there, that <hi>Where Two or Three are gathered together in his Name, there he will be in the midſt of them.</hi> And laſtly, You receive herein, from the Bleſſed Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, that Food, which is neceſſary to the Nouriſhment of the Soul, as Meat is to the Strength of the Body, the ſame Bleſſed Saviour of the World aſſuring us, as you will ſee, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.55. and the 63. compar'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that <hi>His Fleſh is Meat indeed, and that his Blood is Drink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</hi> And then as to the Inward Means of performing God's Laws, <hi>viz.</hi> The Grace and Aſſiſtance of his Holy Spirit, this, as it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to enable our Weakneſs in this our fall'n State; ſo it it is no otherwiſe to be expected than in the Uſe and Miniſtry of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Ordinances, as ſhall be preſently ſeen.</p>
                  <p>In a word, The outward Ordinances, and Inſtitutions of the Goſpel, together with the Holy Spirit accompanying them, are the only ordinary Means of <hi>Converſion.</hi> Some may pretend to be <hi>above Ordinances,</hi> but Experience tells us, that accordingly as Men do ſlight and neglect 'em, accordingly do they decay in Grace and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and when once they begin wholly to lay them aſide, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come perfectly Graceleſs, and are given up to a Reprobate Mind, as is daily ſeen in ſuch as make nothing of Profaning the Lord's Day, and totally laying aſide Prayers and Sacraments.</p>

                  <p>Alas!<note place="margin">They are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valued, till moſt wanted.</note> the ineſtimable Priviledges and Advantages of Divine Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, as the Benefit of the Heat and Light, and all other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Mercies, are never ſufficiently valued, till moſt wanted. In the abundance of 'em, we ſlight 'em, but when depriv'd of 'em, we ſee we cannot live the Spiritual Life without 'em. This is moſt ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantly expreſt, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.11, 12. <hi>Behold, the days come, ſaith the Lord God, that I will ſend a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirſt for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord. And they ſhall wander from Sea to Sea, and from the North even to the Eaſt, they ſhall run to and fro to ſeek the word of the Lord, and ſhall not find it.</hi> You ſee here, that the Famine of Bread is nothing, in compariſon with the Famine of the Word and Ordinances. <hi>I will ſend a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirſt of water, but of hearing the words of the Lord;</hi> which is a much ſorer Famine, for it is a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, which will ſtarve the Soul. And when they are deprived of the Word and Ordinances, then ſhall <hi>they wander from Sea to Sea, and from the North even to the Eaſt, they ſhall run to and fro to ſeek the word of the Lord, and ſhall not find it.</hi> And accordingly, we may always obſerve this difference in Men's Eſteem of thoſe excellent Advantages. In the outward Peace and Proſperity of the Church, when the Church Doors are always open, and Prayers and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments conſtantly Adminiſtred, then how many, that live near the Houſe of God, ſhall ſeldom come at it; and how will others Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely paſs by it, even in time of Divine Service? And how do People, when it is Plentiful, loath this Heavenly Manna? But when Perſecution at any time ariſes, and the Church Doors are ſhut up, and Divine Ordinances are forbid, upon Pain of Death, how then ſhall you ſee thoſe very ſame Perſons go many Miles, and with the utmoſt hazard of their Lives, Aſſemble themſelves together, and take the greateſt Comfort imaginable in Enjoying 'em? This the Experience of all Ages does Confirm; and God grant our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Neglect of his Holy Inſtitutions and Ordinances, may not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to teach us alſo, how to Value and Eſteem the Priviledges and Advantages of 'em, by depriving us thereof. And thus I have at length ſhewed you, how that the Firſt Great Priviledge, which does peculiarly belong to all the Members of Chriſt's viſible Church, as they are the Members of ſuch a Society, is a moſt Reaſonable and Excellent Body of Religion and Laws, together with moſt Profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Edifying Inſtitutions and Ordinances, given and appointed us by him, our ſupreme Head and Governour, to Conduct us to Heaven. And now it is time to proceed, and to ſhew you, how that</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The Second general Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Members of Chriſt's Church, is a ſufficient mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of divine Grace and Aſſiſtance, derived from him, the Head, and Convey'd by his Ordinances, to Enable us to Conform our ſelves to his Religion, and to Obey his Laws.</note> 
                     <hi>We enjoy thereby a great Meaſure of Divine Grace and Aſſiſtance, derived down from him our Head;</hi> and Convey'd by thoſe his Ordinances, to Enable us to Conform to his Religion, and to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:151517:109"/> Obey his Laws. The myſtical Body of Chriſt is often compar'd in Scripture, to the natural Body of Man, and that as for many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo for this very good Reaſon, that as in the natural Body, every Part partakes of Life, and Senſe, and Motion, from the Head, ſo do we, by being Baptized Members of Chriſt, derive Grace and Help from him our Head, <hi>From whom all the Body, by Joints and Bands, have Nouriſhment miniſtred, Increaſeth with the Increaſe of God,</hi> Col. 2.19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">By the ſame Means that Chriſt is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to his Members, is Grace Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed down from him, as Head, to thoſe Members.</note>Now it is eaſy to conceive, how Chriſt, as a <hi>Political Head,</hi> ſhould give Laws to his Spiritual Kingdom, the Church, and how, as ſuch, he ſhould Head and Protect it, and every Member thereof, againſt its Enemies. But the difficulty with ſome, is to conceive, how, as from a <hi>Myſtical Head,</hi> Divine Grace and Aſſiſtance ſhould be Convey'd down from him, to us his Members. But it is but to conſider what thoſe <hi>Joints and Bands</hi> are, which Unite us to Chriſt as our Head, and we may then eaſily conceive, how we ſhall have <hi>Nouriſhment miniſtred unto us, till we Increaſe with the Increaſe of God.</hi> For whatever are the means of Uniting us to him, the ſame are the means alſo of Conveying the Influences of his Holy Spirit down upon us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The firſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion betwixt Christ, and his Members, muſt be each Member's <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to the Catholick Church.</note>And the Firſt great means of Uniting each Member to Chriſt, muſt be its Union to the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> the Body of Chriſt, not Cutting himſelf off from it, either by Renouncing his Covenant with God, or by cauſleſsly ſeparating from the Communion of that Sound, and Orthodox Part of the Church, whereof he is an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Member; and by not giving juſt occaſion to the Officers of Chriſt's ſpiritual Kingdom, the Church, to Excommunicate, or Cut him off for ſo doing. For it is Juſt with the <hi>Myſtical Body,</hi> the Church, as it is with the natural Body of Man. If a Leg or an Arm ſhould be Cut off from the Body, by a Man's own Hand, or by the King's Officers, it cannot receive Nouriſhment from the Head, and for lack thereof muſt ſoon Dye. And ſo in the Church of Chriſt, a <hi>Heretick,</hi> that for denying the Faith and Sacraments; and a <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick,</hi> who for breaking the Communion, ſhall be Cut off from the Church, cannot ordinarily expect to receive Supplies of Grace from Chriſt, the myſtical Head, which by <hi>Keeping the unity of the Spirit, in the bond of Peace,</hi> he might. But it is not ſufficient, in order to its deriving Life from the Head, that a Member be United to the Body only, and to <hi>any</hi> of its Parts, but it is moreover particularly neceſſary, that it ſhould be United alſo to thoſe principal Parts of the Body, where the Blood and Spirits are form'd, and from whence they are convey'd to every ſingle Member. And therefore</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> Its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion to the Lawful Governours and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Church.</note>A Second means of Uniting each Member to Chriſt the Head, and ſo of Conveying ſpiritual Supplies of Grace down from him to ſuch a Member, is its Unity to thoſe Lawful Governours and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which Chriſt has appointed in the Church, by Joining with 'em in the ſame Fundamental Doctrines of Chriſtianity, and by holding Communion with 'em, in the ſame Holy Worſhip of God. The Lawful Governours and Teachers in the Church of Chriſt,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:151517:109"/> are the principal Parts in the <hi>Myſtical Body,</hi> as the Heart, the Liver, and the Brain, are in the Natural. For as in the <hi>Natural,</hi> from theſe principal Parts, are ſent forth that Portion of Blood and Spirits, which give Life and Strength to every ſingle Member; ſo from Chriſt's Miniſters is Communicated, to all the Members of the <hi>Myſtical Body,</hi> that Nouriſhment which maintains the ſpiritual Life in them. All this may be fairly gather'd from <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the Edifying of the Body of Chriſt, till we all come into the unity of the Faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect Man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi> In which Words, the Miniſters of Chriſt's Church, whether Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, as Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, or Ordinary, as Paſtors and Teachers, are ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, for the Holding and Knitting together the Church, and that from them each Member does immediately receive that Nouriſhment of ſound Doctrine, whereby he grows up to be a Perfect Man in the Knowledge, and Practice of true Religion. And indeed, the Graces of the Holy Spirit are Convey'd by thoſe Ordinances, which they only have power to Adminiſter, which brings me</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, To ſhew how,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>III.</hi> The uſe of Chriſt's Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions and Ordinances.</note> that next to the being United to the Church, and its principal Parts, the Miniſters of Chriſt therein, the great Bonds of Union to the Head, and means of Conveying his Grace to the Members, are the Sacraments, and other Holy Offices and Ordinances appointed for that Purpoſe; and of which the Miniſters of Religion, are the only Diſpenſers. For juſt again, as in the <hi>Body Natural,</hi> there are Nerves that Branch from the Head through the Body, conveying the Animal Spirits to every Member thereof; ſo in the <hi>Myſtical Body,</hi> the Church, there are the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of <hi>Sacraments, Preaching, Publick and Common Prayers, and ſuch like Holy Offices,</hi> Adminiſtred by Perſons ſet apart for that Purpoſe, to be the Conveyances of thoſe ordinary Supplies of his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> which he thinks neceſſary to preſerve that Member in Health and Vigour. So that thus at length you ſee, how that in keeping in Union with the myſtical Body of Chriſt, his Church, and with its Lawful Governours and Teachers, and in the uſe of Sacraments, and other Divine Ordinances, thoſe Conduits and Conveyances of his Holy Spirit to us, we ſhall have ſpiritual Life, and Strength, and Vigour, derived down to us from Chriſt, our ſpiritual Head, in like manner, as in the natural Body of Man, the Animal Life, and Strength, and Vigour, is derived down to all the parts of the Body, from the natural Head.</p>
                  <p>And this is a moſt ſingular Priviledge, if compar'd with that little, or nothing of this Nature, which others, who are not Members of Chriſt's Church do enjoy; and alſo it will appear to be a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great Advantage, if conſider'd in it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And Firſt, <hi>If we compare our Happineſs with Others,</hi>

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:151517:110"/> If God would have Ordinarily, and in the way of a <hi>Conſtant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation,</hi> imparted ſo excellent a Gift to any, to be ſure it would have been to the Jewiſh Church; but we are told, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.17. <hi>That the Law was given by Moſes, but that Grace came by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that is, the Graces and Gifts of His Holy Spirit, as well as other Mercies and Favours; ſo that tho' <hi>Moſes</hi> deliver'd Legal Precepts, it is by Jeſus Chriſt we ſhall have the Aſſiſtance, whereby we ſhall be Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to attain unto Holineſs. And as to that Meaſure of Grace, afforded to Holy Men under the Law, whatſoever it were, it was through him, the Promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and in Vertue of that <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, Confirmed with Abraham before the Law;</hi> but the more conſtant Influences of the Holy Spirit, and the fuller Meaſures thereof are derived from him, down upon us now under the Goſpel. And becauſe of that more plentiful Meaſure of Grace and Spirit, Communicated unto us from Chriſt under the Goſpel, does the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle call the Goſpel, the <hi>Miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> in Oppoſition to the Law, which he ſtyles the <hi>Miniſtration of Death,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.8, 9. And does therefore ſo aſſuredly promiſe himſelf Succeſs in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>Such truſt have we in Chriſt to Godward, not that we are ſufficient of our ſelves, to think any thing, as of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God, who hath made us able Miniſters of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or Covenant, <hi>not of the Letter, but of the Spirit;</hi> where the Goſpel is ſtyl'd the Spirit, as for other Reaſons, ſo for this, in the Judgment of the Learned Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> that Grace which is the Gift of the Spirit, is now join'd to the Goſpel, which was not to the Law. In a Word, and to ſpeak in the Words of a Learned Author. <q>Other Laws for want of this, are in effect Miniſteries of Condemnation; Racks of Conſcience; Parents of Guilt, and of Regret; Reading hard Leſſons, but not aſſiſting to do after them; Impoſing heavy Burthens, but not Enabling to bear them. But our Law of the Goſpel is not ſuch, it is not a dead Letter, but hath a quickning Spirit accompanying it; it not only ſoundeth through the Ear, but ſtampeth it ſelf upon the Heart of him, that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely doth Embrace it; it always carryeth with it a ſure Guide to all Good, and a ſafe Guard from all Evil.</q>

And whatever, I ſay, thoſe ſeveral Duties are, which
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:151517:110"/> ariſe from their ſeveral Stations in the Church, they ſhall have a competent meaſure of Divine Grace, Enabling them to diſcharge 'em. They ſhall not have Gifts, that are neceſſary to the Diſcharge of other's Offices, but be deſtitute of theſe of their own; that is, a private Chriſtian, call'd to no Office in the Church, is not to expect, nor ought to pretend to have received Gifts of Government, and Teaching in a publick Miniſterial way, <hi>For God is not the Author of Confuſion, but of Peace in all the Churches of the Saints,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.33. But every Member of the myſtical Body, by keeping himſelf united to the Head, in ſuch ways, as has been ſhew'd, ſhall have ſuch Graces and Aſſiſtances derived down to him from Chriſt, who is that Head, as are neceſſary and proper for him.</p>
                  <p>And, that too, in ſuch Meaſures and Proportions, as, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the different Times and Occaſions in the Church, are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.<note place="margin">And alſo in ſuch Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures as accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Times and Occaſions in the Church, are wanting.</note> Thus in the firſt Plantation of the Goſpel, when the Work was ſo Extraordinary, that there was need of Miracles to convince the Jews of the Inſufficiency of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, and the Gentiles of the Falſhood of the Pagan Superſtition, then did Chriſt beſtow upon his Apoſtles divers extraordinary <hi>Gifts,</hi> viz. <hi>Of Miracles, Prophecy, diſcerning of Spirits, divers kind of Tongues, and the Interpretation of Tongues,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.10. And as to all Chriſtians in general, as the malice of Satan did then moſt violently rage againſt the Church, Perſecuting to the Death thoſe, who would not <hi>Renounce Chriſt, and his Religion;</hi> ſo all the Chriſtians in thoſe Times were very extraordinarily Strengthen'd, no doubt, to reſiſt ſuch ſtrong Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. But now, that the Church is Eſtabliſh'd, and the Truth of Chriſtianity already Prov'd and Believ'd, God does aſſiſt the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Religion only, with the ordinary Graces of his Spirit in the diſcharge of their Miniſtry. And as to Lay Chriſtians therefore, except it be when the Orthodox are call'd out in any Part of the World (as ſometimes they are to this Day) to ſuffer for the Truth, they receive no other than ordinary Aſſiſtances. But this both Miniſters and People are ſure to do, in the uſe of thoſe means, that Chriſt has appointed in his Church for that Purpoſe; ſo very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, on many accounts, are the Priviledges, that do belong to the Members of Chriſt's Church.</p>

                     <hi>THE Seventh Lecture.</hi> Wherein I was made a Child of God.</head>
                  <p>THE Preliminary Queſtions and Anſwers of your Church-Catechiſm, as I have already told you, do give you a general Account of the whole Covenant of Grace. And theſe Words, <hi>Wherein I was made a Member of Chriſt,</hi> being the Firſt of thoſe invaluable Priviledges, made over to us in this Covenant, on God's Part, I have already explain'd, and open'd to you what they do Import.</p>
                  <p>The next of thoſe Priviledges, made over to us in the Covenant of Grace, is expreſt in theſe Words, <hi>Wherein I was made a Child of God,</hi> in order to make you ſenſible of the Vaſtneſs of which Priviledge alſo,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I will ſhew you what is meant in Scripture, and here in your Catechiſm, by a <hi>Child of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, What an ineſtimable Priviledge accordingly it is, to be a <hi>Child of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">What is meant in the Catechiſm by a Child of God.</note>And firſt let us Enquire, What is meant both in Scripture, and here in your Catechiſm, by a <hi>Child of God.</hi> To underſtand which, we muſt Enquire into the ſeveral meanings of this Phraſe, in the Holy Scriptures, and then, in which of thoſe Sences it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, here in your Catechiſm, when every Catechumen is taught to Anſwer, that <hi>In his Baptiſm he was made a Child of God.</hi> And as to the ſeveral Acceptations of this Phraſe, in the Holy Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> Not the Son of God by an Eternal Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</note>Firſt, In the higheſt, moſt natural, and moſt proper meaning of the Word, there is He, who is the Son, or Child of God, by an <hi>Eternal Generation,</hi> viz. Our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who being Begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of God the Father, from all Eternity, in a peculiar, inconceivable, and inexpreſſible manner, ſo as to be Co-equal, Co-eternal with the Father himſelf, is call'd the <hi>Onely Begotten Son of God,</hi> Joh. 3.16. But then, being he is in ſo peculiar and high a manner, the Son of God, as infinitely to exceed, that wherein any one elſe, whether Angels or Men, can be call'd his Sons, he cannot, in any meaſure, be meant here by a <hi>Child of God,</hi> which ſignifies a Priviledge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to many, as will be preſently ſhew'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Not every Son by Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is a Sence too wide.</note>Secondly, There are thoſe, who are the Sons of God by a <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Creation,</hi> and ſuch are Reaſonable Creatures, both Angels and Men; both being call'd the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> as you will ſee, <hi>Job</hi> 1.6. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.38. And that, both upon the account of the manner of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:151517:111"/> their Production, which was by the immediate Power of God, and becauſe of their Spiritual and Immortal Natures, in which both do ſo immediately reſemble God. But this is an Acceptation too wide. That which is meant here by a <hi>Child of God,</hi> is a Priviledge, which all Men in the World do not enjoy, but is the Favour, which is granted to a ſelected Body of Men, who are ſeparated from the reſt of the World; <hi>Behold, what manner of Love the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.1.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There are thoſe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>III.</hi> Nor ſachonly who are Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, by ſpiritual Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is a Sence too narrow.</note> who are the Children of God by <hi>Spiritual Regeneration,</hi> by being Renew'd in the Spirit of their Minds, and by being <hi>Created</hi> anew <hi>in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs.</hi> And theſe are ſuch, <hi>Who have put off, concerning the former Converſation, the Old Man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful Luſts; and who have put on the New Man, which after God is created in Rightouſneſs and true Holineſs,</hi> Eph. 4.22, 23, 24. They are ſuch, who are <hi>Born, not</hi> only <hi>of Water, but</hi> alſo <hi>of the Spirit,</hi> that is, who have not only been Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into the Chriſtian Church, but have been Sanctify'd by the Holy Spirit, and have their whole Natures and Diſpoſitions ſo alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Better, that, from Vicious and Ungodly, they are chang'd to Vertuous and Holy Diſpoſitions and Inclinations.</p>
                  <p>And ſuch a vaſt Change wrought in our Natures by the Word and Spirit of God, may very juſtly give thoſe, who Enjoy it, the Title of the <hi>Children of God;</hi> for if in the way of <hi>Natural Generation,</hi> the Communicating of a Principle of Life, and of ſuitable Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, does found the Relation and Title of a <hi>Father,</hi> there is as good Reaſon why in <hi>Regeneration,</hi> the deriving ſuch Holy and Heavenly Diſpoſitions and Powers from the Word, and the Spirit of God to the Soul, as give to a Man a Divine Nature, whereby he is a Partaker of the Life and Likeneſs of God himſelf, ſhould Entitle God to be alſo a Father, and ſuch, who are ſo Regenerated and Renew'd, his Children. And accordingly in the Holy Scripture we find, that ſuch a Derivation of Strength and Grace from the Word and Spirit of God, does Entitle thoſe, who are Renew'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, to be Children of God. St. <hi>Paul</hi> not only attributing to the Miniſtry of the Word, a Power of <hi>Begetting in Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.15: But withal expreſly aſſuring us, that <hi>As many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the Sons of God,</hi> Rom. 8.14. So that he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a <hi>Child of God,</hi> whoever giving himſelf up to the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of God's Word and Spirit, is thereby <hi>Sanctify'd wholly in his own Spirit, Soul and Body,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.23. ſo as to ſubdue and mortify every Luſt, and every naughty, inordinate and worldly Deſire.</p>
                  <p>And indeed every truly Regenerate Child of God does do ſo; ſuch a One does by the Power of the Word, and in the uſe and ſtrength of that Grace, that God does afford him, ſubdue and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify every Luſt, and every naughty, inordinate and worldly Deſire. So we are expreſly told, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Whoſoever is Born of God, doth not commit Sin, for his Seed remaineth in him, and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God;</hi> that is, a ſanctify'd Child of God, does really hate Sin, the very Temper and Bent of his Soul is againſt it; and as to living in any groſs and wilful Sin, he cannot without much Reluctancy force himſelf to it; his renew'd Nature is ſo much contrary thereto. Such, I ſay, is every <hi>Regenerate Child of God;</hi>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:151517:112"/> and ſuch indeed in a peculiar manner,<note place="margin">Such indeed are in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and in the highest ſence, the Children of God.</note> and in the higheſt and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſence of the Word, that it can be apply'd to a meer Man, is a <hi>Child of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then all, who are the Children of God, either in the ſence of Scripture, or of your Catechiſm, are not actually thus <hi>Regenerate.</hi> As to the ſence of Scripture, it is plain, as will preſently appear, that every One, who bears the Relation of a Child to God, is not Dutiful to his <hi>Father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">But every Child of God is not actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Regenerate, either in the ſence of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</note> 
                     <hi>which is in Heaven,</hi> no more than all Children are to their <hi>Natural Parents.</hi> It is a monſtrous Thing indeed, that any Child ſhould be Undutiful to ſo good and gracious a Father, but it is too true, that too many are ſo: <hi>Hear, O Heaven, and give ear O Earth, for I the Lord have ſpoken; I have Nouriſhed and brought up Children, and they have rebelled againſt me,</hi> Iſa. 1.2. And as to the meaning of a Child of God, here in your Catechiſm, it is alſo plain,<note place="margin">Or of your Catechiſm.</note> that it is not only ſuch as are renew'd in the Spirit of their minds, and do imitate God, that are there to be underſtood; for every One, who is Catechized, is requir'd to anſwer, that <hi>In his Baptiſm he was made a Child of God,</hi> whereas many Catechumens are not actually as yet Renew'd, and really Converted, and by their own Fault, many will never be; ſo that a Child of God, by ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Regeneration, and a God-like Imitation, expreſſes rather the Duty of every One, what he ought to be, than the Notion and Nature of a Priviledge, which many may enjoy, who in the mean time are not over Dutiful. So that a Child of God by ſpiritual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, or a God-like Imitation, is a meaning of the Word, as much too narrow to be the ſence of it, here in your Catechiſm, as a Child by Creation was too wide. To proceed then,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">But, Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a Child of God, as meant in the Catechiſm, is every one who is ſo by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>Fourthly, There are the <hi>Children of God,</hi> by Vertue of a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Relation,</hi> and alſo by <hi>Adoption,</hi> who are neither all the Sons of God by Creation, nor yet on the other ſide, ſuch onely as are Renew'd in the Spirit of their Minds, and do imitate God: But they are all thoſe, who have been <hi>Baptized into the Covenant of Grace, and have been Incorporated into Chriſt's Church, and who do profeſs the true Religion, and themſelves the Servants of the True God.</hi> Thus before the Law, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.2. the whole Houſe and Poſterity of <hi>Seth</hi> are call'd the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> as on the contrary, the Poſterity of <hi>Cain</hi> are call'd the <hi>Daughters of Men.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">This was the Notion of a Child of God before the Law.</note> They are there call'd the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> becauſe that in the Family of <hi>Seth,</hi> the Worſhip of the True God was continued and eſtabliſh'd, from which the Poſterity of <hi>Cain</hi> had Revolted. And ſo likewiſe under the Law, the whole Body of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are call'd the <hi>Children of God,</hi> Deut. 14.1. and that for this reaſon,<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the Law.</note> as it follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. becauſe they were a <hi>Holy people unto the Lord, and the Lord had choſen them to be a peculiar people unto himſelf, above all the Nations that were upon the Earth.</hi> They were a <hi>Holy people unto the Lord,</hi> not all of 'em by an inward and real Change in their Natures, but by a <hi>Foederal Holineſs,</hi> and by reaſon of their ſeparation from the reſt of the Idolatrous and wicked World, by a Holy Covenant. Alas! as to their inward Holineſs, this very Body of Men, who were call'd the Children of God, are ſaid <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.5. to have <hi>Corrupted themſelves, and to have not the ſpot of Children, but to be a very froward Generation, Children in whom is no Faith,</hi> ver. 20. But their outward Relation to God
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:151517:112"/> continued notwithſtanding, and that whole Body of People being in Covenant with God, were ſtyl'd thereupon his Children.</p>
                  <p>And under the Goſpel likewiſe,<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the Goſpel.</note> all that are Members of the Church, and in Covenant with God, are ſtyl'd his Children. Thus 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16, 17, 18. you will find, that with Relation to all thoſe, concerning whom God declar'd, <hi>He would be their God, and that they ſhould be his People,</hi> which are the expreſs Terms of the Covenant betwixt God and all Chriſtians, as you will ſee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. and with Relation to all thoſe, whom he commanded to <hi>Come out from among the Gentiles,</hi> and to be ſeparate, and <hi>not to touch the unclean thing,</hi> that is, not to Partake in their Idolatry, which is the very Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Members of Chriſt's Church; I ſay, with Relation to all theſe, he declar'd he would be <hi>a Father unto them, and that they ſhould be his Sons and Daughters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſuch are call'd Sons by <hi>Adoption,</hi> concerning whom it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Alſo a Child of God, as meant in the Catechiſm, is every One, who is ſo by vertue of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption.</note> 
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5. <hi>When the fulneſs of time was come, that God ſent forth his Son, made of a Woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the Adoption of Sons.</hi> Now this word <hi>Adoption,</hi> is much uſed in the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to declare that filial Relation towards God, which the Members of Chriſt's Church are taken into; and becauſe the right underſtanding of the Nature and meaning of ſuch <hi>Adoption,</hi> will very much contribute to a right and through Explication of what is meant by a <hi>Child of God,</hi> I will</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Shew you the Nature and Meaning of Adoption, both amongſt the Jews and Gentiles, amongſt both which different People it was in uſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>I will then ſhew you, how we Chriſtians, eſpecially ſuch of us, who are deſcended from the Gentiles, are accordingly Adopted to be the Children of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as to the Firſt:<note place="margin">Adoption, What?</note> 
                     <hi>Adoption</hi> (a Thing ſo well known both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Jews and Gentiles) <hi>was the taking in of a Stranger upon the want, or loſs of natural Iſſue, into the Relation of a Child, and into the Rights and Priviledges of a Son by Nature.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The uſe of it amongſt the Iſraelites, &amp; the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges it gave them.</note> As to the uſe of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> we find <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. that <hi>Rachel</hi> upon the want of Iſſue by her Husband <hi>Jacob,</hi> did Adopt, and take as her own Sons, thoſe of her Maid <hi>Bilhah,</hi> ver. 5.8. And ſo likewiſe did <hi>Leah, when ſhe ſaw that ſhe had left Bearing,</hi> ſhe Adopted, and took alſo, as her own Children, the Sons of <hi>Zilpah.</hi> And ſeveral other the like Inſtances may be found in Scripture, as in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Adopting <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> to be his Sons, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.5. In all which caſes it appears, that upon their Adoption, or being took into that Relation of Sons to <hi>Jacob, Rachel,</hi> and <hi>Leah,</hi> they were inſtated into equal Priviledges with the true and genuine Iſſue of thoſe Perſons, and were accounted amongſt the Twelve Patriarchs of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> equally with the reſt.</p>
                  <p>And as to the like Cuſtom of <hi>Adoption,</hi> amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The uſe of it amongſt the Gentiles, and the Rights it confer'd upon them.</note> you'll ſee, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.21. how that <hi>Moſes, when he was caſt out, Pharaoh's Daughter took him up, and nouriſhed him as her own Son,</hi> that is, Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him as ſuch. And by that Right of Adoption he would have Inherited the Crown of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> but that <hi>By Faith, when he was come to Years, he refuſed to be called the Son of Pharaoh's Daughter; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming the reproach of Chriſt greater Riches than the Treaſures of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:151517:113"/> Egypt,</hi> Heb. 11.24.26. Thus the <hi>Egyptians</hi> Adopted: And how the ſame Cuſtom did alſo prevail amongſt both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> is a Thing well known to thoſe, who read their Authors, but need not here be further mention'd, the Scripture uſe of this Cuſtom being what it does moſt concern you to know. To haſten therefore,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">How we Christians, eſpecially ſuch who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the Gentiles, are accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as has been ſpoke, the Adopted Children of God.</note>Secondly, I am now to ſhew you, <hi>How we Chriſtians, eſpecially ſuch of us, who are deſcended from the Gentiles, are accordingly Adopted to be the Children of God.</hi> I ſay, how <hi>we Chriſtians,</hi> for to the Jews <hi>did once pertain the Adoption,</hi> Rom. 9.4. and that whole Church and Nation were once <hi>His Children,</hi> Deut. 14.1. To underſtand which, you are to conſider, that the whole World, who were the Sons of God by Creation, having Revolted from God, to ſerve ſtrange Gods, then did God chooſe <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Poſterity, to be a <hi>Holy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a peculiar People unto himſelf,</hi> and to that purpoſe did Enter into Covenant with him and them, and ſo Adopted them to be his Children, inſtead of the reſt of Mankind, who had wholly forſaken him.<note place="margin">To the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites did once pertain the Adoption.</note> And hence it is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. that <hi>To the Iſraelites did once pertain the Adoption, and the Glory, and the Covenants, and the giving of the Law, and the ſervice of God, and the Promiſes.</hi> Thus the Jews alone were once the Adopted Children of God.</p>
                  <p>And now the Queſtion returns, <hi>How we Chriſtians, eſpecially ſuch of us, who are deſcended from the Gentiles, are according, as has been ſpoke,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">To laſt only till the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the Goſpel.</note> or the Goſpel <hi>came,</hi> the Jews <hi>were kept under the Law, which was their School-maſter, to bring them to Chriſt: But after that Faith,</hi> or the Goſpel was come, <hi>they were to be no longer under a School-maſter, but were to be the Children of God, by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3.23, 24, 25, 26. that is, after they were ſometime Train'd up,<note place="margin">After which they, and all Chriſtians, were to be Children of God by faith in Chriſt.</note> and exercis'd to Obedience, by that ſevere Diſpenſation given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> God did deſign to preſcribe 'em, by his own Son, a more <hi>Reaſonable Service,</hi> namely, That contain'd in the Goſpel; Ordering that That ſhould thenceforward be the Rule of Obedience, to all ſuch as would be his Adopted Children: And accordingly <hi>When the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent forth his Son, made of a Woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law, that they might receive the Adoption of Sons,</hi> Gal. 4.4, 5. that is, when that time was come, wherein God ſaw it fit to lay that lower Diſcipline, the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> aſide, then God ſent his own Son in Humane Fleſh, who ſubmitted to, and perform'd the whole Law himſelf, to redeem 'em out of that Slavery of Moſaical Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, and to receive them into the Participation of his Promiſes, and to be his Children, without thoſe Legal Obſervances, by Faith in Chriſt, and Obedience to his Goſpel. But the Jews being ſtill of a Childiſh Diſpoſition, and fond of their Chains, as People, long accuſtomed to Slavery, commonly are, would not forego their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Obſervances for the more Manly Religion, and more <hi>Reaſonable
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:151517:113"/> Service</hi> of the Goſpel of the Bleſſed Jeſus. And thus refuſing Chriſt,<note place="margin">But the Jews adhering to their Law, and refuſing Chriſt, and his Goſpel, in whom God had predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated all to be his Sons, the Apoſtles turned unto Gentiles, Preaching Chriſt, and Salvation to them, and to as many as receiv'd him, to them gave he Power to be the Sons of God.</note> in whom <hi>God did predeſtinate us all into the Adoption of Children by himſelf, according to the good Pleaſure of his Will,</hi> Eph. 1.5. the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles by the appointment of God, did thereupon <hi>turn to the Gentiles Acts</hi> 13.46, 47. Preaching Chriſt and Salvation by him, unto them, and <hi>to as many as Receiv'd him, to them gave he power,</hi> or the Right and Priviledge, as it is in the Original, <hi>to become the Sons of God,</hi> Joh. 1.12. This is a remarkable Text to our Purpoſe. In the Two Verſes immediately before, <hi>viz.</hi> The 10, and 11, it is ſaid, <hi>He was in the World, and the World was made by him, and the World knew him not; he came unto his own, and his own received him not, but as many as received him, to them gave he Power,</hi> or the Right and Priviledge, <hi>to be the Sons of God, even to them, who Believe in his Name.</hi> So, that by this time, I hope it does fully appear to you, what is meant by a <hi>Child of God,</hi> eſpecially in that ſence, wherein it is to be underſtood here in your Catechiſm. And you ſee, as he is not every Child by Creation, which is a ſence too wide; ſo neither on the other ſide, is he only One, who is ſo by Regeneration, which is a ſence as much too narrow; but every One is ſuch, who has Enter'd into Covenant with God, and whom the Heavenly Father, has thereupon <hi>Adopted</hi> into his Family, to partake of the Priviledges, which belong to his Adopted Sons, which,</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">What are the Priviledges, which do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Children of God, as ſuch.</note> Brings me next to Enquire what a Vaſt Priviledge it is, accordingly, to be <hi>made the Children of God.</hi> And truly upon Enquiry it will be found to be in general the very ſame Priviledge in Kind, but infinitely greater in Degree, (as Heavenly Things are always greater than Earthly) which the moſt Tender and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Father, that is withal Wiſe, as well as Good, can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to allow his own Children, beyond what he will do to <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Aliens.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In general, ſuch as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent, but wiſe Father, may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to allow his Children beyond Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens and Strangers.</note> For is it natural to ſuch a One more eaſily to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the Offences of his Child, than of his Slave, more favourably to over-look his Infirmities, more readily to hear his Requeſts, and to inſtate him in a ſurer Title to his Poſſeſſions, than he will do others, that have no ſuch Relation to him? Why ſuch are the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges our Heavenly Father will allow to us, who are his Children by <hi>Adoption,</hi> above others, who ſtand in no ſuch Relation to him. He will be Juſt to all, but theſe are properly Fatherly Kindneſſes, and he will Indulge 'em to none therefore but thoſe, who are his Children. But more particularly,<note place="margin">Particularly,</note>

                  <p>Firſt, It is worthy our Conſideration,<note place="margin">

The unbelieving Jews and Gentiles, and all Perſons remaining in a State of Nature, who have not Embrac'd the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, who have not been Baptized, nor have Enter'd into Covenant with God, have no Aſſurance from him, that their Sins ſhould be ever Pardon'd, tho' they ſhould forſake 'em, becauſe God never gave any Promiſe of Pardon to any other but his Children, who are in Covenant with him.</p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:151517:114"/>
                  <p>And for want of their having any expreſs Engagements and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes from God, of Mercies from him, does the Apoſtle therefore ſpeak of the State of the Gentiles, as exceedingly Uncomfortable, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.11, 12. in theſe very remarkable Words: <hi>Remember that ye being in times paſt Gentiles in the fleſh, and at that time ye were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, being Aliens from the Commonwealth of Iſrael, Strangers from the Covenants and Promiſes, having no hopes</hi> of Pardon, <hi>and without God in the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we Chriſtians, who have Enter'd into Covenant with God, and ſo are his Children, have the utmoſt Aſſurance poſſible, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the moſt gracious and expreſs Promiſes, that upon laying down our Rebellious Arms, upon our Renouncing of his, and our own moſt mortal Enemies, our Sins, and Coming over to him, we ſhall have all our Sins Pardon'd. Or rather as the Apoſtle himſelf does expreſs it in the following, <hi>viz.</hi> The 13, 14 ver. <hi>But now in Chriſt Jeſus, ye who ſometimes were far off, are made nigh by the Blood of Chriſt, for he is our Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed, that this Pardon and Peace with the Father, does more peculiarly belong to us under the Character of his <hi>Children,</hi> who had formerly ſtray'd afar off from him, by our Sins, but are now return'd Home to him, by Repentance, we have Exemplify'd to us in that famous Parable of the Prodigal Son, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. That Perſon, we there read, after a moſt Lewd and <hi>Riotous Life,</hi> after he had ſpent and ſquander'd away all his Subſtance, that his Father gave him, yet upon his deep Humiliation, for his Vile and Undutiful Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour towards his Father, and his hearty Deſires to return Home, and to his Duty and Obedience to him, was thereupon admitted to his former Intereſt in his Father's Affections; Yea, and receiv'd with more than uſual Joy. Why, the whole Deſign of that Parable is to ſhew us, how our Heavenly Father will graciouſly deal with us, his Undutiful and Rebellious Children; and that after, even a very ill Life, upon our laying down of our Sins, the forſaking the ſervice of our Luſts, and Return to him, he will graciouſly Pardon and Forgive us, his <hi>Children.</hi>

The Rigour of the Firſt Covenant would admit of no leſs than a <hi>Perfect, Exact, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſinning Obedience,</hi> the never Offending in any one Point. <hi>In the day thou doſt eat thereof thou ſhalt ſurely dye,</hi> Gen. 2.17.

                  <p>In a word, As the Pardon of Sins, whether great, or ſmall, is a Mercy held out to us only in the Covenant of Grace, ſo it is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us under this very Notion, of being Children of God, as appears
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:151517:114"/> from <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17. where the Prophet foretels the Happy State of Chriſtians, upon this very Score, in theſe words, <hi>And they ſhall be mine,</hi> ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, <hi>in that day, when I make up my Jewels, and I will ſpare them, as a man ſpareth his own Son, that ſerveth him.</hi> And more particularly yet, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3.5.7. Forgiveneſs of Sins is there ſpecify'd, as the diſtinct Priviledge of <hi>Adopted Sons,</hi> in theſe words; <hi>God the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, having predeſtinated us unto the Adoption of Children by Jeſus Chriſt unto himſelf, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the good pleaſure of his Will; in him we have Redemption through his Blood, the Forgiveneſs of Sins, according to the Riches of his Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, Thirdly, which is an Appendage to this ſame Priviledge;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>III.</hi> To the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God is granted an eaſier Acceſs by Prayer, to the Throne of Grace, for Pardon of Sins, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mercies.</note> 
                     <hi>A Child of God,</hi> upon the Score of ſuch his Relation, is permitted to have an eaſy Acceſs to the Throne of Grace; and is admitted to Addreſs himſelf in Prayer to God, as for whatever other Mercies he ſtands in need of, ſo for Pardon of Sins, when he has Tranſgreſt, with a full Aſſurance of a gracious Anſwer. The Gentiles, who ſerv'd no Gods, but what their own Imaginations created, did it after a Slaviſh manner; for how could they be ſure the Offended Deity was to be Entreated, when he had Reveal'd no ſuch thing unto 'em? And ſo did the Jews alſo, who ſerv'd the True God, it was in a Servile manner too, for when they had committed an Offence againſt the Law, they were to provide their <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and bring it to the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and he was to Offer it for 'em, whilſt they ſtood at a diſtance. But now the Veil of the Sanctuary being broke, upon the Death of our High-Prieſt, <hi>We have therefore the Liberty to enter into the Holieſt, by the Blood of Jeſus, by a New and Living way, which he hath Conſecrated for us, through the Veil, that is to ſay, his Fleſh: And having him our High-Prieſt over the Houſe of God, we may hence-forward draw near with a true Heart, in full Aſſurance of Faith, having our Hearts ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience,</hi> Heb. 10.19, 20, 21, 22. that is, Every Chriſtian, provided he comes not with the guilt of any unrepented Sin upon his Conſcience, may himſelf now Offer up his own Prayers to God through Chriſt, without the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of any other Prieſt, or Sacrifice, and that with a full Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of being graciouſly heard and anſwer'd.</p>
                  <p>And that this Faith and full Aſſurance, with which we may Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto God, to Pray to him for the Forgiveneſs of Sins, is our Priviledge only, as we are the Sons of God by Adoption, is plain from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 8.15. <hi>Ye have not received the Spirit of Bondage again unto fear, as under the Law, but ye have received the Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby we cry unto God, Abba Father.</hi> And again, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Becauſe ye are thus made his Sons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now Laſtly, If there be any other very conſiderable Priviledge,<note place="margin">Laſtly, A Child of God is more ſurely inſtated in the Inheritance of Heaven, than others.</note> accruing to a Child of God, from ſuch his Relation, it is, That God will more ſurely Inſtate him in the Inheritance of Heaven, than he will do others, that have no ſuch Relation to him: <hi>And,</hi> indeed, <hi>if Children</hi> of God, <hi>then Heirs,</hi> we are told, <hi>Heirs of God, and Joint-Heirs with Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.17. But the Vaſtneſs of this will be beſt conſider'd by us, when we come to the Explication of that Third, and the laſt of thoſe Priviledges made over to us, on God's Part, in the Covenant of Grace; <hi>viz.</hi> What it is to be an <hi>Inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">The infinite reaſon we have to praiſe God for theſe Advantages.</note>And now, upon the Review of what has been ſaid, in the Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of this preſent Article, In what Admiration of God's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may we all of us cry out with St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 Epiſt. 3.1. <hi>Behold what manner of Love the Father hath beſtow'd upon us, that we ſhould be call'd the Sons of God?</hi> And what infinite Reaſon have we, with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> thankfully to Praiſe him for it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3.5. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath Bleſſed us</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>with all Spiritual Bleſſings</hi> in, and concerning Heavenly Places, and Concerns of the World to come, <hi>through Chriſt; having Predeſtinated us to the Adoption,</hi> and Priviledges of Children, <hi>by Jeſus Chriſt unto himſelf, according to the good Pleaſure of his Will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He Adopted us to be his Children according to the good Pleaſure of his Will.</hi> This Priviledge, that we ſhould be his Children, is Attended with very rich Advantages, all which have accru'd to us, not from any Merit and Deſert of ours, being ſuppos'd Enemies unto him; but only from his free Goodneſs towards us, which was pleas'd ſo to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it. And as it is both Great and Free, we ought certainly, with all poſſible Acknowledgments, to Magnify and Extol, both his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Condeſcenſion and Goodneſs, and our own unſpeakable Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Dignity therein. <q>Indeed, for God to be a Father by Creation and Providence (as One obſerves) tho' it be a Mercy, yet it is no Priviledge; for in that Sence he is <hi>Parens rerum,</hi> the common Parent of all things: But, that God ſhould be thy Father by Adoption, that he ſhould make thee his Son, through his only Begotten Son, that he ſhould rake up Dirt and Filth, as thou art, and lay it in his Boſom; that he ſhould take Aliens and Strangers near unto himſelf, and Adopt Enemies and Rebels into his Family: Regiſter their Names in the Book of Life, make them Heirs of Glory, Co-heirs with Jeſus Chriſt, his Eternal Son, as the Apoſtle doth admiringly re-count it, <bibl>
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17.</bibl>
                     </q> This is Mercy and Miracle both. It is, indeed, an invaluable Grace and Favour, that we ſhould be Adopted his Children, were it only for this, that he will be ready to Pardon our Sins and Infirmities, and will Admit us favourably to Addreſs our Selves, and Prayers to him. But this Priviledge of being his Children will farther appear, to be beyond all Expreſſion, Great, ſince, if Children, as the Apoſtle infers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. then Heirs, Heirs of God, and Joint-Heirs with Chriſt; If a <hi>Child of God,</hi> then, which Crowns all the reſt of his Covenanted Mercies, <hi>Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> which yet, it is ſaid we ſhall be; But what, and how Great that Third, and Laſt Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Covenant is, I am in the Explication of the next Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle to declare unto you.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This is the Perfection of all God's Promiſes and Favours, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed in the Second Covenant. It comes laſt, and Crowns all the reſt. And it will be the certain Reward of all thoſe, that perſevere to the end of their Lives in well-doing, and in ſincere Obedience (notwithſtanding all Temptations to the contrary) to God's moſt Righteous Commands. <hi>Be faithful unto Death,</hi> ſays our Saviour, <hi>and I will give thee a Crown of Life,</hi> Rev. 2.10. And that you may throughly underſtand the vaſt greatneſs of this moſt extraordinary Priviledge, made over to you by Covenant, ſo as to be excited thereby to render your ſelves worthy to be Partakers thereof; according to my uſual Method I will Explain to you,</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>By the Kingdom of Grace in this Life,</hi> I mean, that Happy and Bleſſed State of us Chriſtians, now under the Goſpel, wherein we Enjoy the Happineſs of Living under a Government, wholly made up of manifold Graces and Favours; having a moſt Gracious God, governing us by moſt Gracious and Reaſonable Laws,<note place="margin">The Kingdom of Grace, the Goſpel State.</note> affording us a plentiful Meaſure of Divine Grace and Aſſiſtance to perform theſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:151517:116"/> Laws, and propoſing to us moſt Encouraging Rewards in Heaven, to ſtir us up to a diligent Obſervance of 'em.</p>
                  <p>It is this happy State of Things, under the Title of the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> whoſe near Approach <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt foretold in the Wilderneſs, ſaying, <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand,</hi> that is, the Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> or the State of the Goſpel, whoſe Great, Fundamental, and Gracious Law, is this, that all Sinners muſt Repent 'em of all their former Sins, and upon their Repentance they ſhall have moſt Eminent Mercies, beſtowed upon 'em. And it was this State alſo, concerning the undue Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which by the Scribes and Phariſees, our Saviour complain'd, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.12. ſaying, that <hi>From the days of John the Baptiſt, even till then, the Kingdom of Heaven ſuffered Violence, ſo that the Violent took it by force;</hi> that is, the Publicans, and Sinners, and Gentiles, who were look'd upon by the Jews, as thoſe, who had no Right to the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and ſo as violent Perſons, as Invaders and Intruders, did croud into the Church at the Preaching of the Goſpel, whilſt the Scribes and Phariſees ungratefully and proudly ſtood off.

And thus you ſee that in Scripture, by the Kingdom of Heaven is ſometimes meant the State of the Goſpel, the ſame God governing us therein, and by the ſame everlaſting Laws of Goodneſs, as in Heaven, and ſo as to render us of like Tempers and Diſpoſitions with the Saints in Heaven. A State ſo nearly reſembling that of Heaven, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the meaneſt Chriſtian now under the Goſpel, is, for that reaſon, prefer'd before that of the greateſt of Prophets under the Law; <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, among them, who are born of Women, there hath not riſen a greater than John the Baptiſt, notwithſtanding he that is leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> that is, the Goſpel State, <hi>is greater than he,</hi> Matth. 11.11.</p>

For Inſtance, In this ſence it is to be underſtood, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.3. where the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> is promis'd as the Reward of the <hi>Poor in Spirit.</hi> And ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 20. where it is ſaid, that <hi>Except our Righteouſneſs ſhall exceed the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, we ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> that is, into the State of Glory. And in this ſence only it can be underſtood, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.21. where our Saviour declares, that <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto him, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth the Will of the Father, which is in Heaven;</hi> that is, not thoſe, who barely profeſs Chriſtianity, but thoſe, who ſincerely Practice according to ſuch a Belief and Profeſſion, ſhall be received into Glory. The Profeſſion alone will gain Admittance into the Viſible Church here on Earth, but nothing leſs than a Living up to it, will give an Entrance into the Kingdom and State of Glory, with God and his Holy Angels, and Saints in the higheſt Heavens.</p>
                  <p>And a moſt Noble and Glorious State we may be ſure this is,<note place="margin">This, a moſt noble and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious State, as being dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify'd with ſo honourable and glorious a Title, as the Kingdom of Heaven.</note> or elſe it would not be Dignify'd with ſo Honourable and Glorious a Title, as the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> a Kingdom being the Top and Height of all Earthly Glories, as Heaven is a Place, which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all future Excellencies. To denote therefore that moſt exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed State of Bliſs in Heaven, it is, that this State is call'd the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</hi> And truly there is nothing in this World, wherein we can imagine the greateſt Glory and Happineſs, as a Kingdom, a Crown, a Throne, a Marriage, a Feaſt, but are ſet forth as Emblems to repreſent to us the Joys and Glories of our future State. And yet, as if a Kingdom, a Crown, a Throne were infinitely too ſhort, to ſet forth the Joys and Glories of Heaven, and thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite

So that in ſhort, the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> does import a State of the moſt exceſſive Glory and Happineſs, that our Natures can be capable of receiving; A State ſo unſpeakably Honourable and Delightful, that tho' the choiceſt Things of this World, thoſe Things, that yield the vaſteſt Contentments, are made uſe of in Scripture to repreſent them to us, yet they are but the meer ſhadows of the Glories and Joys in the Kingdom of Heaven; and after all, there is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly more than can be Expreſt, or Imagin'd by us.

                     <note place="margin">An Inheritor of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, What?</note>Secondly, Let us next ſee, what it is to be an <hi>Inheritour of it.</hi> An Inheritour, or Heir, both in Scripture, and in common Language, does import ſomething of Priviledge more than ordinary: Thus <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.10. we find, that <hi>Sarah</hi> would not endure, that the Son of the Bond-woman ſhould enjoy the Priviledge to be <hi>Heir</hi> with her Son. And as to common Account every Body knows, that an <hi>Heir</hi> has a conſiderable Priviledge above the reſt of the <hi>Children,</hi> and what it is, I ſhall Define as follows;</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">An Heir is one, who has a legal Right and Title to a Poſſeſſion made over to him.</note>An Heir amongſt Men is one, that receives from Parents, or Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, either by Nearneſs of Blood, or by Adoption, by Entail, or by Will; or whatever other Method of Conveyance, a ſure Right and Title to a Poſſeſſion. And here perhaps it might not be difficult to ſhew, how that an <hi>Inheritour of the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> is made ſuch by ſomething, that bears a near Reſemblance, at leaſtwiſe, to all theſe Ways and Methods, whereby Men become Heirs to Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Poſſeſſions. But not to inſiſt upon any nice Compariſon in theſe Matters, it is ſufficient to Enſure unto us the Benefits of Heirſhip, even to the Kingdom of Heaven, that thoſe, who are in Covenant with God, are frequently in Scripture ſtyl'd Heirs; and particularly <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Heirs of Salvation,</hi> and that they are in like manner, and to all Intents and Purpoſes as much Heirs,<note place="margin">Such who have Enter'd into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, are in like manner</note> as Children are Heirs, for thus the Apoſtle argues, <hi>If Children, then Heirs, Heirs of God, and Joint-heirs with Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.17. <hi>And if a Son, then an Heir through Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 4.7. So that we may ſafely ſay, That as an Heir is One, whoſe Eſtate is not precariouſly depending upon the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:151517:117"/> meer Will and Pleaſure of another, but ſo ſetled and ſecur'd to him,<note place="margin">Heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven, as Children are Heirs.</note> as to give him a Legal Claim and Title thereto, ſo long as he does not forfeit his Title, by not performing the Condition on which his Title depends; ſo an Heir of the Kingdom of Heaven is One, who does not depend meerly upon the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncovenanted Goodneſs of God,</hi> for his hopes of Heaven and Happineſs; but he is One, to whom God through Chriſt, has vouchſafed to grant a Legal Claim and Title thereto, by giving his ſolemn Promiſe, and engaging his Truth for the Performance, that he will infallibly beſtow upon him the moſt unſpeakable Joys of Heaven, provided he ſwerves not from his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance and Obedience to him, but Renouncing all God's Enemies, the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, will Believe in him, and Obey him truly and faithfully all the days of his Life.</p>
                  <p>I do ſay, (and pray mark it) That God, <hi>through Chriſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">It is through Christ alone, not owing to the Merit of our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that we are Intitled to the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Kingdom of Heaven.</note> has vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to grant us a Legal Claim and Title to this Inheritance; for ſo it is ſaid, that we are Heirs, <hi>through Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 4.7. And far be it from any to imagine, that there is any thing of Merit, or Worth in our imperfect Obedience, whereby of it ſelf it ſhould deſerve ſuch a precious Inheritance. It would be an Arrogance and Preſumption in the higheſt Saint, that ever liv'd, and ſuch as would render him more liable to be Puniſht for his Pride, than rewarded for his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ſhould he pretend to Claim Heaven, meerly upon the Score of his own Sanctity; or ſhould he pretend a Claim and Title to the Inheritance of Heaven at all, otherwiſe than <hi>through Chriſt,</hi> and becauſe God has promis'd it. However, ſince God has been pleas'd to Enſure it to us by Covenant, we may ſafely call it a Right, which God, who is Faithful in all his Promiſes, and Juſt in all his Dealings, will never debar us of; except by our Diſloyalty and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to him, we forfeit all Right and Title to it. Which brings me to my</p>
                  <p>Third Propoſal, which was to lay before you the Vaſtneſs of our Priviledge, in being <hi>made Inheritours of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay, <hi>In it ſelf very Great.</hi> Indeed, what can be greater, than to have the invaluable Poſſeſſions of Heaven,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> It is in it ſelf a very Great Priviledge, to have the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of Heaven, ſo ſetled and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd, as to have a legal Claim and Title thereto made over to One.</note> ſo ſetled and enſur'd to us, as to have a <hi>Legal Claim and Title</hi> thereto, made over to us <hi>in Chriſt.</hi> We ſee, as to thoſe Earthly Poſſeſſions, how an Heir does value his Condition above the reſt of the Children, not only on the account of a greater ſhare, commonly in the Eſtate, than the reſt; but becauſe of the greater ſecurity he has of Enjoying thoſe Earthly Poſſeſſions; An Inheritance being an Eſtate, for which he does not ſo precariouſly depend, as has been ſhew'd, upon the meer arbitrary and uncertain Will and Pleaſure of another, but a Right, which without Breach of Juſtice, cannot be detain'd from him. It is the Priviledge of an Heir, that he has all the Security, that the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of an Honeſt Perſon, and the Solemnities of a Covenant can give him, to make him a Title; but when the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> is the Poſſeſſion, and when he, who cannot deceive, has ſolemnly ſetled
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:151517:118"/> this Inheritance upon us; this is a Priviledge ſo much beyond what Words can expreſs, that it is far eaſier to be Admir'd, than Utter'd.</p>

They conſider'd the noble Nature of the Soul of Man to be ſuch, that nothing in this Life is of that Excellency, as to give it a full Satisfaction; and as to the Body, they look'd upon it more, as the Priſon of the Soul, than any Advantage to it, and therefore they did hope to be deliver'd one Day from its Incumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; that the Soul might be at liberty to act freely, without ſuch a Clog of Fleſh traſhing it in all its noble Flights and Operations: But then all this was in them but Conjecture, what poſſibly might be, not what certainly would be their Happineſs. And being but a <hi>faint Hope,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">And their Hopes being faint, they could not in the Strength thereof over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come great Temptations.

And his Hope being thus built, not upon uncertain Conjectures, but upon the expreſs Promiſes of God, who cannot lie;<note place="margin">And being ſuch, there is no Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo alluring, nor Suffering ſo great, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he may not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome.</note> there is no Temptation ſo alluring, nor Suffering ſo great, that ſuch a Hope will not be able overcome; <hi>But he, that hath this Hope, purifieth himſelf, even as God is pure,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.3.

Thus certain are the Chriſtian's Hopes of Heaven, it being inſtated upon him, as an Inheritance. And having his Hopes ſo well grounded, there is no difficulty in the way of Duty ſo great, which he may not overcome by the Strength thereof: Whereas the beſt of the Moral Heathens had but uncertain Conjectures to ground their Expectations of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Happineſs upon; and their Hopes thereof being ſo Weak, they preſently yielded to the Aſſault of every great Temptation.</p>

                  <p>The Second Priviledge is, That we are alſo hereby <hi>made Children of God,</hi> that is, having Embrac'd Chriſtianity, and being Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into the Church of Chriſt, we are thereby Adopted and Choſen out of the reſt of the World by God, to enjoy this grand Priviledge of Sons, to have Pardon granted us, when with the Prodigal Son, we return Home to Him, our Offended, but Gracious Father, by Repentance: And we ſhall find him not over-ſevere, in reſpect of our leſſer Failings, and the unavoidable Infirmities of our Nature, but ſhall always have him ready to hear our Prayers for Mercy, both in reſpect of our greater and leſſer Tranſgreſſions.</p>
                  <p>And Laſtly, The Third Priviledge, you have been now told, is this, that to compleat All, We are <hi>made Inheritours of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven,</hi> that is, have ſecur'd to us a Right and Title to the unſpeakable Joys and Glories of Heaven. A Priviledge which, conſider'd in it ſelf, is exceeding Great, and as all the reſt, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with what Others enjoy, is a very <hi>ſingular</hi> One.</p>
                  <p>Theſe now are the ineſtimable Priviledges, made over to us in the Covenant of Grace. Priviledges, which as they are of infinite Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to us, ſo we ſhall never fail of obtaining 'em, if we will but take care to perform the Conditions requir'd on our Parts; and ſo, Firſt, <hi>Renounce the Devil, and all his Works, the Pomps and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of this wicked World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Believe all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith.</hi> And, Thirdly, <hi>Obey God's Holy Will and Commandments, and walk in the ſame all the days of our Lives.</hi> Which Conditions, and what they Import, I come next to declare unto you.</p>

                     <hi>THE Ninth Lecture.</hi> Firſt, That I ſhould Renounce the Devil, and all his works, the Pomps and Vanity of this wicked world, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh.</head>
                  <p>I Have already Expounded thoſe infinitely Gracious and Invalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Priviledges,</hi> made over to us, on God's Part, in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace; having ſhewed you, what it is to be a <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſt,</hi> what it is to be a <hi>Child of God,</hi> and laſtly, what to be an <hi>Inheritour of the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> as alſo, what are the vaſt Benefits contain'd in thoſe ſeveral Articles; I am now come to Explain to you likewiſe, the <hi>Conditions</hi> of the Covenant; thoſe Conditions, without the Performance of which, thoſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies will not be Confer'd on us.</p>
                  <p>For this we muſt ſeriouſly conſider, that the Benefits now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd to be made over to us, as they are in themſelves exceeding great, ſo as almoſt to equal us with the Bleſſed Angels; and as they were purchas'd for us at no leſs a Rate, than the precious Blood of the Son of God; ſo we muſt not expect, that Benefits ſo infinitely great, and dearly purchas'd, ſhould be Confer'd upon us, without any thing to be done on our Parts, to expreſs our Value of them; much leſs if we continue in Rebellion againſt God, and inſtead of him, ſerve under his Enemies, the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil; or will be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels and Unbelievers, and will remain Diſobedient to all his moſt Juſt and Righteous Commands. No, it is not to be imagin'd, that God will be ſo Eaſy, ſo fond of Sinners, as would reflect upon the Wiſdom and Diſcretion of a meer Man. But as he does propoſe to us <hi>Invaluable Bleſſings,</hi> ſo he does require from us a <hi>Reaſonable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> and the Performance of moſt Equitable Conditions; amongſt which, this is the Firſt, that we ſhould <hi>Renounce</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And as I have already Explain'd to you the Importance of thoſe vaſt <hi>Favours on God's Part;</hi> ſo I will proceed now to do the ſame, as to thoſe <hi>Conditions on ours,</hi> ſhewing you</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>What it is to Renounce the Devil, and all his Works,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Whereof the Firſt is, to Renounce the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh.</note> 
                     <hi>the Pomps and Vanity of this wicked World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is as much Matter as can poſſibly be crowded into ſo few Words. A great Part of the Chriſtian Life is diſcharged in what theſe Words do mean: For our Chriſtian Race is repreſented in Scripture to be, for the moſt part, a Warfare againſt ſeveral very powerful Enemies, both without and within us. And
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:151517:120"/> theſe Words do Inſtruct you, both what thoſe Enemies are, and how we muſt War againſt them. Wherefore, if in the Explication of Words ſo very full of Meaning, and of ſuch vaſt Concernment to be underſtood by you, I ſhall be forc'd to run out into ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Length, you muſt have Patience, and you muſt give good heed to what I ſhall Diſcourſe upon them, anſwerable to the Benefit, may accrue to you from the through underſtanding thereof. That which I ſhall do towards the Explication of them, ſhall be this;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>I will ſhew you who the Devil is, and what are his Works, what is meant by Renouncing the Devil, and all his Works, and how abſolutely neceſſary it is we ſhould do ſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>I will alſo ſhew you what is meant by the Pomps and Vanity of this wicked World, and how far you muſt Renounce the wicked World, with its Pomps and Vanity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>I will in like manner, open unto you, what is to be underſtood by the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh, and how far we muſt Renounce them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, Firſt, <hi>I am to ſhew you who the Devil is, what are his Works, what is meant by Renouncing the Devil, and all his Works, and how abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary it is we ſhould do ſo.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <note place="margin">The Devil, his Names, and their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</note>Whereof Firſt, Let us enquire <hi>who the Devil is.</hi> And in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he is call'd by different Names, whereof ſome do import his Rank and Place, as <hi>Baalzebub,</hi> ſignifying him to be a Prince of Devils; and ſome his Wickedneſs and Enmity, as <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying a Calumniator, or a falſe Accuſer; <hi>Satan,</hi> an Adverſary; from his Fury and Murderous Temper, he is call'd a <hi>Roaring Lion;</hi> and from his Craft and Lying Policies, an <hi>Old and ſubtle Serpent;</hi> and from both perhaps he is call'd the <hi>Dragon.</hi> There are many Legions of 'em in Number, but One ſupreme in Power; and He it is, who is Chief of all the Enemies, both of God and Man, that preſents himſelf at the Head of all the reſt,<note place="margin">He was once one of the higheſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and is now that Arch-Rebel againſt God.</note> being that Arch-Rebel and Traitor againſt God. He was once, as may be gather'd from his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority to <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel, who upon that account <hi>Durſt not bring a railing Accuſation againſt him,</hi> Jude 8.9. The higheſt Angel, the moſt glorious Spirit, and the Firſt be-like of all the Angelical Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: But not content with that vaſt Power and Glory, that God had beſtow'd on him, but envying that God, that gave it, and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">He, with many Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Angels, whom he drew into the ſame Conſpiracy, is Baniſht Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> perhaps, no leſs than a Sovereignty himſelf; He, with many Legions of the lower Order of Angels, whom he drew into the ſame horrid and ungrateful Conſpiracy, Revolted from God, and ſet himſelf to Oppoſe his Government. But no ſooner did this wicked Apoſtate frame ſo horrid a Deſign, but the All-knowing and infinitely Powerful God of Heaven and Earth, perceiving his Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, immediately hurl'd him down, and all his wicked Crew of ungrateful Conſpirators, from the Battlements of Heaven, into thoſe dark Manſions of Sorrow, which we call Hell, there to be <hi>Reſerved in everlaſting Chains under darkneſs, unto the Judgment of the great Day,</hi> Jude 6. as the due Puniſhment of his ſo black and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Treaſon againſt his Sovereign and Bountiful Creator. But ſo far was this hardned Rebel againſt God, from Repenting of his Villany, even under the ſad Experience of the woful Iſſue of it, That he is everſince acted with the higheſt Spirit of Revenge againſt
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:151517:120"/> his God;<note place="margin">Being acted with a Spirit of Revenge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, he afterwards with-drew Mankind to join with him in his Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</note> and becauſe he finds it in vain to attempt any thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately againſt God himſelf, he ſtudies and endeavours all he can ever ſince, to wound him in his Authority and Honour. For no ſooner did the Almighty Create the lower World, and place Man in the midſt of it, as of a Temple, to ſet forth his Praiſes, and to glorify his Creator's infinite Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs in this ſo ſtupendious a Work of the Creation; but this grand Enemy, Attacks him with all the Subtilty and Policy of a Traytor, tempting him to diſ-believe his Maker's Goodneſs and kind Intentions towards him, to caſt off his Authority, and diſ-obey his Laws, and rather to follow his pernicious Counſels. The <hi>Arch-Rebel</hi> prevails, and the whole <hi>Repreſentative</hi> World of Men, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> Revolted from their God, and took part with the Devil. And tho' God conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending himſelf to propoſe Terms of Accommodation in a Saviour and Redeemer, which was for to come, recover'd a part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, both before and after the Flood, and afterwards ſelected the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> to be a peculiar People unto him, ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to ſerve him; yet through the Inſtigation of Satan, the greater part of Mankind were abſolutely the Devil's Vaſſals,<note place="margin">And prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo far, till God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most utterly baniſht from amongſt men.</note> ſerving him in abominable Idolatries, Sorceries, Witchcrafts; and giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to all manner of Villanies, Vices, and Sins whatſoever, whereby the Laws of God could be tranſgreſs'd, or his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity utterly Baniſh'd (as far as lay in their power) from amongſt the Sons of Men. And thus the Devil uſurpt an Authority over al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the whole World for many Thouſand Years, till ſuch time, as our Saviour came amongſt us to Preach Repentance,<note place="margin">Which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd the Son of God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the World, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</note> and to recover us to the Knowledge, and the Service of the One True God, which was the great Deſign of his Coming.</p>
                  <p>So that you ſee the Devil is that Arch-Rebel, who with his whole Legion of Infernal Spirits, are continually muſtering up all their Forces, againſt the Authority of God, and drawing wretched ſinful Men into the Conſpiracy; and whoſe Quarrel is for no leſs than Dominion and Empire, who ſhall be King, God, or Satan. And thus you plainly ſee, who the Devil is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Let us enquire what are the <hi>Works of the Devil;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The works of the Devil in general are</note> and from what hath been ſaid, his Works in general do appear,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>To be Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, Secondly, <hi>The tempting of us to Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His firſt work was to Sin himſelf, by tranſgreſſing God's Laws,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">I. <hi>Sin.</hi>
                     </note> and deſpiſing his Authority. His next work was to Tempt and Inveigle us likewiſe into the ſame Violation and Contempt of the Divine Laws and Authority, by committing of Sin.</p>
                  <p>And the firſt general Work of the Devil is Sin, for ſo it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly affirm'd, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. <hi>The Devil ſinneth from the beginning, and for this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil;</hi> that is, Sin.<note place="margin">By Sin God's Authority is thrown off, which is the Devil's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant work.</note> By Sin the Laws of God are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs'd, his Authority thrown off, his Government diſ-own'd, and his Power defy'd; and as the Devil made himſelf what he is, by thus ſinning at firſt; ſo this is his continual Practice, his conſtant Work ever ſince: And whoſoever in imitation of him, does likewiſe at any time Tranſgreſs, or walk contrary to the Laws, the Rules, the Ways that God hath ſet, (eſpecially if knowingly and wilful)
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:151517:121"/> does thereby in like manner,<note place="margin">Whoever therefore does wilfully ſin, does ſtrike at God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</note> as the Devil did, throw off God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, diſown his Power, and defy his Government, and ſo does do the Works of the Devil. Which one Conſideration ſhould make you abominate even the leaſt Sin, but eſpecially it ſhould make you infinitely fearful of Sinning wilfully againſt your Maker. Moſt People, alas! in theſe degenerate Times, make but a <hi>Mock of Sin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">For which reaſon no Sin ought to be the ſubject of any Man's Mirth.</note> and make it the Subject of their Mirth and Laughter, when committed by themſelves, or others, for want of ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering this to be its Nature. But the Commiſſion of the leaſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sin, would be dreaded by you, and frown'd upon in others, if you would but conſider how high it ſtrikes, even at God himſelf, and whom it Advances to his Right of Dominion over the World, even the Devil.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Some Sins more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the works of the Devil.</note>But as there are ſome particular Sins, which are more directly level'd againſt God's Authority, and expreſs more of the natural Temper and Diſpoſition of Satan, and are more his own Practice than others; ſo of thoſe we may ſay, that they are more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and eſpecially the Works of the Devil.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> Such as are directly Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel'd againſt God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>viz.</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry.</note>
                     <hi>And firſt as to thoſe, which are more directly level'd againſt God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> and are therefore Sins of Satan's own Invention, to draw us off from God; of this ſort we are to reckon <hi>Idolatry,</hi> or the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping of other Gods, beſides him the Onely True God; whether it be that of the Barbarous Nations, who worſhipt the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; or whether that of the Gentiles in general, and ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiliz'd Chriſtians, as the Papiſts, who <hi>Worſhip the Creature,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>above, beſides, or together with the Creator,</hi> as that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.25. may indifferently be render'd. The Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of either Kind, either the Worſhip of Devils, Heroes, or of Saints departed, does more particularly bear upon it the Character of a Work of the Devil, becauſe it is more direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly level'd againſt God's Authority, giving his Honour to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Sorcery, Charming, Witch-craft, and Conjur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as alſo Reſorting to ſuch as uſe thoſe unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Arts.</note>Of the ſame ſort is <hi>Sorcery, and Charming, and Witch-craft, and Conjuring,</hi> as alſo the Sin of thoſe wretchedly wicked Perſons, who <hi>Reſort to Conjurers, and Charmers, and Witches,</hi> White, or Black (as ſome do fooliſhly diſtinguiſh them, for both do deal with the Devil, by unlawful Arts) whoever, I ſay, do reſort to any ſuch Perſons, or ſuch as are ſo reputed, to enquire out their loſt Goods, or what ſhall be hereafter their Fortune, or to receive Directions for Health, or Thriving; or if they uſe themſelves any Spells and Charms to theſe, or the like Purpoſes; ſuch do commit a principal Work of the Devil, becauſe they hold thereby a Commerce and Correſpondence with Satan, who is God's moſt bitter Enemy, and do put their Faith and Confidence in him for Help, making him, <hi>viz.</hi> the Devil, inſtead of God, their Staff and Stay: And laſtly, do commit that Sin, which is the particular Invention of the Devil, and is therefore often in the Holy Scriptures, as for Inſtance, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. Deteſted as ſuch an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination, and Threatned with ſuch heavy Penalties, as muſt argue thoſe, who can uſe ſuch unlawful Means for Health, or for finding out loſt Goods, to be even utterly deſtitute of any Fear of God, and ſuch, who wholly give themſelves up to fear, and ſerve only the Devil; and I hope therefore, as common as it is, it will be
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:151517:121"/> Deteſted by you. But the Divine Indignation is ſo fully Expreſt againſt all the Sins of this Kind, in this 18th of <hi>Deut.</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. that I muſt not forbear to give you the very Words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as thoſe, which are moſt likely to Deter you from ſuch high Provocations. <hi>There ſhall not be found amongſt you any one that uſeth Divination, or an Obſerver of Times, or an Inchanter, or a Witch, or a Charmer, or a Conſulter with familiar Spirits, or a Wizard, or a Necromancer; for all that do theſe things are an Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination unto the Lord: and becauſe of theſe Abominations, the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee. For theſe Nations, which thou ſhalt poſſeſs, hearken'd unto Obſervers of Times, and unto Diviners.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A Second ſort of thoſe Diabolical Sins,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> Such as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs more of the Devil's Temper, than others, <hi>viz.</hi> Pride.</note> 
                     <hi>which may be more particularly ſtiled the Works of the Devil, are thoſe, which Expreſs more of the very Natural Temper and Diſpoſition of Satan, than others:</hi> And ſuch are <hi>Pride, Envy,</hi> and <hi>Malice.</hi> That <hi>Pride</hi> is the very Temper of Satan, may be gather'd from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. He was Tempted by that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Condition, in which he was Created, to conceive highly of his own Dignity, and Greatneſs, and Merits; and to have tow'ring and ambitious Thoughts of Uſurping to himſelf a greater Power, and larger Province, perhaps, than God had given him; and for this his Pride (and his Rebellion the Effect of it) he was caſt out of Heaven, and Excluded the Bleſſed Manſions of the <hi>Poor in Spirit, whoſe is the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Matth. 5.3. And it does there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concern every One of you, to take care of harbouring in your Breaſts the leaſt Degrees of Pride and Vanity, and of being Exalted in your own Minds, upon the account of any thing, you Enjoy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others, whether a more flouriſhing Condition in the World, or greater Succeſs in your Affairs, or upon the account of your greater Skill and Knowledge, <hi>Leſt, being lifted up with Pride, you fall into the Condemnation of the Devil,</hi> as it is in the now cited Place of <hi>Timothy.</hi> And indeed <hi>Pride,</hi> in whatever ways it ſhews it ſelf, ought moſt carefully to be Subdu'd and Mortify'd, as a Sin moſt truly <hi>Diabolical;</hi> for it is to be conſider'd, That tho' the Devil be the firſt Author of all Sin, and inſtigates to every Kind, yet there are many, which Satan himſelf cannot commit: As for Inſtance, He cannot be Drunk, nor commit Lewdneſs, and the like, himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe are committed only in, and by the Body, whereas he is a Spirit; but yet he is Naturally Proud and Ambitious: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, tho' thoſe other, as being more viſible and ſenſible, are more Scandalous in the Eyes of Men; yet this more Spiritual Wickedneſs, Pride and Ambition, and a Pharaſaical Cenſoriouſneſs, and Thinking more Highly of One-ſelf, and more Diſreſpectfully of Others, than is meet, are more truly <hi>Diabolical,</hi> and have more in their Nature of the Devil's Temper.</p>
                  <p>And as Pride, ſo <hi>Envy</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Envy.</note> is another of the Devil's Qualities. The Devil, through his Pride and Rebellion, having loſt that high Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Dignity he once enjoy'd in Heaven; and ſeeing Man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to a Capacity of obtaining a Share in that Glory and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, from which he is excluded: He is poſſeſt with the utmoſt Envy, both towards God and Man; Envying God the Service of us his Creatures, and us both the Happineſs of ſerving ſo Good a Maſter,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:151517:122"/> and thoſe infinite Rewards, which will be given us, for our faithful Service and Obedience to him.</p>
                  <p>And from this his Envy proceeds that Rancourous <hi>Malice</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Malice.</note> alſo, wherewith he is ever ſince Acted, ſo as to be continually Contriving how to do us the greateſt Miſchief; from whence he is called our <hi>Adverſary, the Devil,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.8. Envy and Malice are indeed the very Natural Temper and Diſpoſition of Satan; ſo that he ſeems to be wholly made up thereof. 'Twas Pride, as One ſaid, made him Envious, his Envy, that made him Spiteful and Malicious, all which together make him a <hi>Devil.</hi> And therefore, as you would not appear to have ſomething Diabolical in your very Natures, <hi>Let all Bitterneſs, and Wrath, and Anger, and Clamour, and Evil-ſpeaking be put away from you with all Malice; and be Kind one to another, Forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, even as God, for Chriſt's Sake, hath Forgiven you,</hi> Eph. 4.31, 32.</p>

                        <hi>III.</hi> Such as are more the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan himſelf, than other Sins, <hi>viz.</hi> Murder.</note>Laſtly, There are ſome Sins more the Devil's own Practice, than others, and do therefore deſerve to be more particularly Styl'd the <hi>Works of the Devil:</hi> And there are theſe Three, <hi>Apoſtacy, Murder,</hi> and <hi>Lying,</hi> which are expreſly mention'd as his own Sins, in that One remarkable Place of Scripture, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44. <hi>The Devil was a Murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the Truth, becauſe there is no Truth in him: When he ſpeaketh a Lie, he ſpeaketh of his own; for he is a Liar, and the Father of it. He was a Murderer from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> He delights in humane Gore; and no doubt the vaſt Slaughters of Men, which have been made in Bloody Wars, have been through the Inſtigation of Satan, ſtirring up Ambitious Princes unjuſtly to Invade their Neighbours Countries, that he might Glut his Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite with Blood: And for the ſame Reaſon he Oblig'd the Pagans, his Worſhipers, to offer Men in Sacrifice to him. And there is no Duel fought, but he is firſt at the making of the Challenge, and then at the Murderer's Elbow to direct the fatal Thruſt. In theſe laſt ſort of Murders, he hopes to do Two Works at once, to deſtroy both Body and Soul in one inſtant; and to be ſure he will never fail being preſent, where he can, to all Intents and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, ſo effectually do the work of a <hi>Deſtroyer,</hi> as he is ſtyl'd, <hi>Revel.</hi> 9.11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He abode not in the Truth.</hi> Hereby is denoted his <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoſtacy.</note> and Falling off from God, and his Service; another of Satan's principal Works of Sin. And if any of you, who have given up your Names to Chriſt, to be his Diſciples and Followers, ſhould hereafter, inſtead of <hi>Renouncing the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil,</hi> as you have ſolemnly Profeſſed in your Baptiſm, give your ſelves up to the Service of Satan, of Mammon, and of your filthy Luſts; why, you will be reckon'd amongſt thoſe, that are Apoſtates from God, and <hi>are turned aſide after Satan,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.15. Nay, and if you ſhould fall off from the Truth (as it is here Profeſt in this Church, of which you are Members) to any <hi>Heretical Doctrines,</hi> you will Imitate Satan in his Apoſtacy, who abode not in the Truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Lying, and eſpecially Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniating, and Evil-ſpeaking.</note>
                     <hi>When he ſpeaketh a Lie, he ſpeaketh of his own; for he is a Liar, and the Father of it.</hi> A <hi>Lie</hi> was that whereby he deceiv'd and ruin'd Man at firſt; (<hi>Ye ſhall not ſurely dye,</hi> ſaid Satan, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.4. So contrary
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:151517:122"/> to what God himſelf had Threaten'd our Firſt Parents, in caſe they ſhould Eat of the forbidden Fruit): And it is by erroneous and falſe Doctrines (which as Tares he ſows in the Field of the Church) whereby he has undone ſo many Souls ever ſince. You muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Abhor a <hi>Lye,</hi> or Speaking that which you do not Know to be exactly agreeable to the Truth of Things, as you will not make your Selves <hi>Children</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Father, the Devil.</hi> And eſpecially you muſt beware of that ſort of Lying, whereby you will moſt nearly Reſemble him, and that is in Slandering and falſly Accuſing of any One, to the Ruine of his good Name. Satan is particularly Stigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in Scripture for this ſort of Lying, and is therefore called <hi>The Accuſer,</hi> or Slanderer, <hi>of the Brethren, which accuſeth them before God, Day and Night,</hi> Rev. 12.10. and it is obſervable, that 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.11. where Women are charged not to be <hi>Slanderers,</hi> nor falſe Accuſers, the Word in the Original is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, not to be Devils, which ſhould be a Warning to them, as they would dread ſo Black a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, to avoid Entertaining one another with Backbiting, and ſpeaking Evil of their Neighbours; which yet I am afraid is the moſt uſual Converſation, when that Sex do meet together. Indeed as the <hi>pernicious Lye,</hi> utter'd for the Hurt, or Diſadvantage of our Neighbour, is the moſt truly <hi>Diabolical;</hi> So all ſorts of Lying what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, renders ſuch as are Notorious for it, Contemptible and Vile amongſt Men, and Odious to God: as does ſufficiently appear by the Place and Company, they are Rank'd with, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.15. <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi> that is, Hell, <hi>are Dogs, and Sorcerers, and Whoremongers, and Murderers, and Idolaters, and whoſoever loveth and maketh a Lye;</hi> which ſhould make you of all things in the World, my Dear Youth, to Beware of this Odious, Helliſh Sin of Lying; and I do the more earneſtly preſs you to Hate and Abhor it, becauſe Youth are moſt apt to be Addicted to it. And ſo much for Sin, conſider'd as a Work of the Devil. And now,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We ſhould proceed to conſider that other great Work of Satan, his Tempting of us to Sin. But this, as it has been his great Employment ever ſince the Creation of Mankind, and will be ſo, as long as there are Men on Earth to be Tempted by him: And as his Methods of Temptation are very many, and very ſubtle, and it does infinitely concern us, <hi>Leſt Satan ſhould get an Advantage of us, that we ſhould not be Ignorant of his Devices:</hi> For theſe Reaſons, I do think it may be profitable to you, if I make that great Work of his, his <hi>Tempting us to Sin,</hi> the Subject of ſome particular Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes by themſelves, in order to a more full and diſtinct State of that matter; as indeed it is very requiſite you ſhould be throughly Inform'd, if poſſible, of the Temptations of Satan, what they are. And therefore leaving that Part for the preſent, I ſhall proceed to finiſh this Lecture with ſhewing you,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, What it is to <hi>Renounce the Devil, and all his Works</hi> of Sin,<note place="margin">To Renounce, a Word of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Renounced.</note> already ſpoken of, <hi>and how neceſſary it is we ſhould abſolutely and entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do ſo.</hi> To <hi>Renounce,</hi> is a Word, that is apply'd in our Baptiſmal Vow to ſeveral things, even all our Spiritual Enemies, that would draw us into Sin. <hi>The Devil, and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanity of this wicked World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh; they muſt all
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:151517:123"/> of them be Renounced by us.</hi> And as the Word <hi>Renounce</hi> does carry in it a great deal of Meaning, and is of various Significations, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Nature of the things to be Renounced: So what it does particularly ſignify, with Reference to each of them, will beſt be underſtood by conſidering its Importance, as apply'd to every One of thoſe things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">To Renounce the Devil, in the ſence of the Ancient Church, was to diſclaime his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurped Dominion &amp; Authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Mankind.</note>And agreeably therefore to the Explication now given of the Devil. <hi>To Renounce the Devil,</hi> is, no doubt, to Diſclaim his Uſurpt Dominion and Authority; or to leave off having any Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Agreement with him, or having any Hand in his baſe and ungrateful Rebellion againſt God.</p>
                  <p>This was, no doubt, what the Primitive Church underſtood by Renouncing the Devil, (for they are Words of a very ancient Uſe in the Church of God.) The Devil, at the firſt Riſe of Chriſtianity, eſpecially, had obtain'd a Viſible Kingdom, and, in a manner, an Univerſal Monarchy over the World: Hence he is call'd, <hi>The Prince of this World,</hi> Joh. 14.30. He had alſo his Temples, and his Altars, and his Sacrifices. <hi>The things, which the Gentiles Sacrifice, they Sacrifice unto Devils, and not unto God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.20. As alſo many lewd and bloody Plays, and pompous Proceſſions were made in Honour of him, and he was therefore in Effect, <hi>The God of this world,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.4. And now, when any were Converted from Paganiſm to Chriſtianity, the Primitive Chriſtians did expreſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, from all, that were admitted into that <hi>Kingdom of God, the Church of Chriſt,</hi> a publick and open <hi>Renunciation,</hi> or Abjuration of him, or an utter Diſowning and Abandoning the Devil's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and the Paying any Homage, Service, or Obedience to him, by Worſhiping of him, or his wicked Angels, or by going to thoſe Plays and Proceſſions Inſtituted in Honour of him. Thus does <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> an ancient Father, inform us in his Book <hi>De Corona,</hi> wherein reciting the ancient Cuſtoms of the Church, he tells us, <hi>That juſt before any were Baptized into the Chriſtian Religion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aquam adituri, ibidem, ſed aliquanto prius in Eccleſia, ſub Antiſtitis manu conteſtamur nos Renuntiare Diabolo, &amp; Pompae, &amp; Angelis ejus. <hi>Tertul. de Corona.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>they made a ſolemn Profeſſion, at their Entrance into the Water, as alſo they had done, a little before, when under the Biſhop's Hands, in the Church, That they did Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Devil, his wicked Angels, and Pomps;</hi> that is, thoſe ſolemn Proceſſions of the Heathen Gods, and thoſe Lewd and Cruel Plays, us'd amongſt the Pagans, which were the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of State, as it were, in Satan's Kingdom. All ſubjection to the Devil, and all uſage of thoſe Rights of his Kingdom, they did utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abandon and forſake. And this was what was meant in the Primitive Times by <hi>Renouncing of the Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">To Renounce his Works of Sin, was in their Sence, to Abandon and Forſake every Sin, as being the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per Service of the Devil.</note>
                     <hi>And to Renounce his works of Sin,</hi> muſt accordingly ſignify in their Sence, to diſclaim, abandon, or forſake every Sin, as being the proper Service of the Devil; and in the real Meaning of it, no leſs than a throwing off God's Authority, and a diſowning his Power. For if you will read over <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. you will find, that People upon their forſaking of the True God, to ſerve other Gods, (which were many of 'em at leaſt, no other than Devils) did thereupon fall into all manner of Sin and Wickedneſs, as you will ſee largely deſcrib'd in that Chapter. And if you will alſo look into the Sixth Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ver. 11. you will ſee, that Chriſtians by being Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:151517:123"/> 
                     <hi>Were to reckon themſelves to be dead unto Sin, but alive unto God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> So that in the Original, and firſt meaning of the Words, as to Renounce the Devil, was to abjure and diſclaim the Power and Dominion of Satan, and to leave off having any Communication, or Agreement with him, and any Hand in his baſe and ungrateful Rebellion againſt God; ſo to Renounce his Works of Sin, was to Diſclaim, Abandon, or Forſake all, and every Sin, as being the proper Service of the Devil; and in the real Meaning of it, no leſs than a throwing off God's Authority, and a diſ-owning of his Power. This, I ſay, was the firſt Meaning of the Words, in the firſt Ages of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Nor are they to be Interpreted in a much different Sence at this Day. For Satan has his Kingdom ſtill in the World,<note place="margin">The Words are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in much the ſame Sence at this day; Satan having his Kingdom ſtill in the World, and even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and the Laws of Sin, which are the Laws of his Kingdom, being ſtill O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd by the greateſt Part of Mankind.</note> and the Laws of Sin, which are the Laws of that his Kingdom, are Obey'd by the greateſt Part of Mankind. The barbarous Nations amongſt the Pagans, do directly ſerve him at this Day; and it is many a Chriſtian's Lot, who is caſt amongſt 'em, to be forc'd, either to Join with 'em in ſuch Impious Service, or to ſuffer Death with Torments, for refuſing. And even in the Chriſtian Pale, tho' his Power is much weaken'd here, ſince the Coming of our Saviour, to what it was before, yet ſtill, as Chriſt has his Church, ſo Satan has his <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue</hi> amongſt us; and too many there are, within the Limits of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> who do openly and avowedly Obey no other, than the Laws of his Kingdom. All your <hi>Atheiſts and Deiſts, who Blaſpheme God, and the Chriſtian Religion;</hi> and all your Profane Swearers and Curſers, whom you ſhall hear every Hour in the Day to Dare God, as it were, by their horrid Oaths and Imprecations to Damn 'em, that is, to ſend 'em to the Devil; and all thoſe, who reſort to Charmers, and Conjurers, and Fortune-tellers (as many Thouſands do in this Nation:) All theſe, I ſay, are the open and profeſt Subjects of <hi>Satan's Kingdom.</hi> And how many Lewd and Riotous Livers are there amongſt us, who do little elſe but the Works of the Devil, and Obey no other Laws, but thoſe of Sin? So that as you will <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Devil, and all his Works,</hi> in that Sence, wherein the Church does at preſent underſtand the Words, you are with all poſſible care to avoid being of the Number of ſuch Men.</p>
                  <p>And I know no more that need be ſaid at preſent,<note place="margin">This Renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation for the moſt Part the ſame with Repentance.</note> to explain the Importance of the words, <hi>Renounce the Devil, and all his Works,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be this; That if we conſider ſuch a <hi>Renunciation,</hi> as the Act of One, who has been heretofore a Slave to Satan, and a Servant to Sin, then it ſignifies to Forſake and Abandon the Service of Sin and the Devil, formerly Liv'd in; and ſo being a Ceaſing to do Evil, and a Learning to do well, is the ſame with Repentance. But if it be the Act of one of thoſe, who may be ſaid to need no Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, of which ſort are Infants, who have never committed <hi>Actual Sin,</hi> then to <hi>Renounce the Devil, and all his Works,</hi> does mean a firm Reſolution, never to ſide with him in his Rebellion againſt God; and as carefully as he can, to avoid the committing of any Sin, as being that, whereby God's <hi>Rightful Authority</hi> is caſt off, and the Devil's <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpt Dominion</hi> ſubmitted to. And ſo much for the Meaning of <hi>Renouncing the Devil, and all his Works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:151517:124"/>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Devil, and all his works of Sin muſt be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely Renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, becauſe,</note>And now Laſtly it remains, that I ſhould ſhew you, how that it is neceſſary, we ſhould <hi>Abſolutely and Entirely</hi> Renounce the Devil, and all his Works. As to thoſe other Enemies to our Souls, the World, and our own Fleſh, there is ſome Temper to be us'd, being neither of 'em are Abſolutely, and in themſelves Evil, but only by accident, when the World is too intenſely Belov'd, and our Fleſh too much Indulg'd, to the Prejudice and Hurt of the Soul; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there are ſome Degrees of Affection and Regard allow'd to both them. But the Devil is <hi>the Evil One,</hi> and he is by way of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and Singularity ſtyl'd, <hi>the wicked One,</hi> in the Holy Scripture, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.19. and 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.13.19.<note place="margin">There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil proceeds from Satan.</note> So that there's not the leaſt Good, and nothing but Evil, proceeds from him; and therefore no manner of Agreement is to be made with him; <hi>What Concord hath Chriſt with Belial,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.15. Nor are we to imagine we can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide our Service betwixt God and him; <hi>We cannot ſerve God and Mammon,</hi> Matth. 6.24. So that the Devil is <hi>Abſolutely and Entirely to be Renounced by us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">And Sin, whether we conſider it in its Original Cauſe &amp; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; or in its ſad Effects and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, is the utmoſt Evil.</note>
                     <hi>And ſo likewiſe muſt his Works of Sin.</hi> Sin as Sin, is entirely Evil: Conſider it in its Original Cauſe and Nature, and conſider it in its Effects and Conſequents, and there is not a worſe Evil in the World than Sin: View it in its Original and firſt Cauſe, and it is a Brat of the Devil's, the Firſt-born of Hell. And view it again in its Nature, and it is a Chooſing of quite other Ends, than what the Wiſe and Good God has appointed us, and ordain'd us for; and is a Going quite croſs to thoſe Laws and Rules, which he has given us. And then conſider it next in its ſad Effects and Conſequents, and there is no Evil in the World to be compar'd to it. <q>It is a Sin, ſays One, which turn'd glorious Angels into hideous Devils, and tumbl'd them down from Heaven, to Hell: It is Sin, that fill'd the World with Woes and Plagues, brought Death and Diſeaſes, and a vaſt and endleſs Summ of Miſeries into it. It is Sin, that torments and terrifies the Conſcience, that kindles Hell Flames, Expoſes the Soul to the eternal and direful Revenges of the Great God: And in a word, Sin is ſo perfectly and only Evil, that the worſt of things here, were they free from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion and Evil of Sin, would be Excellent and Amiable.</q> So that Sin alſo is <hi>Abſolutely and Entirely to be Renounced by us;</hi> and there is no one Sin, nothing in the leaſt of Sin, that may willingly be comply'd with.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Therefore no one Sin, nor any thing the leaſt of Sin, muſt willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be comply'd with.</note>I ſay, <hi>No One Sin, nor any the leaſt of Sin,</hi> for ſo Poiſonous a thing it is in ſpoiling of every thing, that is Good in Man, that if we ſhall <hi>allow</hi> our ſelves but in One ſingle Sin, it will utterly ſpoil all our other Righteouſneſs. <hi>If a man keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one Point, he is guilty of all,</hi> Jam. 2.10.

                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed it is but to conſider,<note place="margin">And indeed if the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Satan, and of Sin, &amp; the horrid Conſequence of yielding to either, be well conſider'd, it is hardly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and entirely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce both.</note> as well as know the Nature of Satan, and of Sin, and the horrid Conſequence of yielding to either of them; and it is impoſſible any ſhould not abſolutely and entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Renounce, that is, utterly deteſt, and avoid, and beware of them. As for the Devil, why?

                  <p>And if we did but conſider the odious Nature of Sin, we ſhould not more Abhor the Devil himſelf, than Abandon every Sin: For why? <hi>He that committeth Sin is of the Devil,</hi> we are told, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. Such a One is of the Devil's Party, he is a ſharer in the Devil's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt God, and in his wicked Deſigns to deſtroy God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: And tho' he be not a Devil himſelf, yet he is near a-kin to him, and ſhall Partake with him, as in his Rebellion, ſo in his Puniſhment: And who, that conſiders this, can ſtick Entirely to abandon and to abhor ſo foul a thing as Sin is.</p>
                  <p>But however, whether People will conſider it or no,<note place="margin">However, this if we do not do, we ſhall forfeit all Right and Title to thoſe infinite Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings held forth in the Covenant of Grace.</note> ſo neceſſary it is, that every Chriſtian ſhould abſolutely and entirely Renounce the Devil, and all his Works of Sin; that this if you do not do, you will forfeit all your Right and Title to thoſe infinite Bleſſings, held forth to you in the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and Purchas'd for you by the Blood of Chriſt. If you do not utterly Renounce the Devil, by having nothing to do with him, in his foul Rebellion againſt God, you will be accounted no <hi>Members of Chriſt's Church,</hi> but of the <hi>Synagogue of Satan,</hi> as the Apoſtatizing Gnoſticks, thoſe great Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God are call'd, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.9. and that for their Halting betwixt God and Satan.

                     <hi>THE Tenth Lecture.</hi> Firſt, That I ſhould Renounce the Devil, and all his Works.</head>
                  <p>I Have already ſhew'd you, Firſt, who the Devil is, and Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Part, what are his Works. All <hi>Sin</hi> whatſoever, I have ſhew'd you, is a <hi>Work of the Devil;</hi> but there are ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Sins, which being more directly level'd againſt God's Authority, and expreſſing more of the natural Temper and Diſpoſition of Satan, and being more his own Practice, than others, do more particularly deſerve the Title and Character of the <hi>Works of the Devil;</hi> and what they are I have ſhew'd you.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>And as Sin, ſo his Tempting of us to Sin is another main and principal Work of the Devil.</hi> And I have reſerv'd this Subject of Satan's Temptations, to be particularly handled in ſome ſet Diſcourſes by themſelves, that ſo I might have more room to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe 'em to you; there being no ſubject in Practical Divinity of greater Conſequence and Concernment to our Souls, than to be throughly Informed in the Ways and Methods of Satan's Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now to Tempt one,</hi> in the general Notion of the Word,<note place="margin">To Tempt, is to make a Tryal of a Perſon.</note> 
                     <hi>does barely ſignify to make Tryal of a Perſon, either by Words, or Signs, by Promiſes, or Threats, whether or no he will do ſuch a thing.</hi> And the Tempting of a Perſon may be Morally Good, or Evil, according to the End, for which ſuch a Tryal is made. If the Tryal be of a Perſon's <hi>Vertue,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">To Tempt, a thing morally Good or Evil, according to the End thereof.</note> only that Occaſion may be afforded him to give an Experiment and Proof thereof: that ſo if he do well, he may be Rewarded; if Ill, that his <hi>Hypocriſy,</hi> and the Corruption of his Heart may be diſcover'd, and he himſelf Humbled with the Sight and Senſe thereof to his Amendment, There is nothing may hinder a Governour eſpecially, thus to Tempt any one; and therefore to Tempt a Man to this End,<note place="margin">To Tempt a Perſon, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to prove his Vertue, or diſcover his Corruption, conſiſtent w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the Juſtice, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs of a Governour; and thus God does Tempt Men.</note> may very well conſiſt with the Wiſdom, Juſtice, and Goodneſs of God. And accordingly we find in Scripture Two Eminent Inſtances of God's Tempting Perſons to both theſe Purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>And Firſt we find, <hi>That God Tempted Abraham to try his Faith, and to Reward him for it.</hi> And he did it to as high a degree, as was ever heard of, bidding him to <hi>Take his Son, his only Son Iſaac, whom he loved, and to get him into the Land of Moriah, and to offer him there for a Burnt Offering,</hi> Gen. 22.12. The Tryal was ſevere enough; but God did put <hi>Abraham</hi> upon it with no other deſign, but that he might have occaſion given him to exerciſe his Faith in God. And
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:151517:126"/> by giving ſuch a Noble Demonſtration thereof, as to Reſign up his own Son to be Sacrificed at God's Command, and with his own Hands too,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> Thus he Tempted A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham to try his Faith, &amp; to Reward him for it.</note> he might thereby Teſtify both to God and Man, how much he Truſted in his Maker; and thereupon might obtain the Honour upon Earth, to be accounted the Father of the Faithful, among all Generations of Men; and in Heaven, to be the Higheſt in the Ranks of all Humane Inhabitants, it being the Priviledge of the greateſt Saints to be Lodg'd in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom. And to the ſame Gracious Purpoſes it is, that he does <hi>Tempt</hi> his Faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, when at any time he lets looſe the Enemies of the Church upon 'em, to perſecute and deſtroy 'em: It is to the Intent, that giving an extraordinary Proof of their Faith, and Conſtancy, and Patience, and Love to him, he may extraordinarily Reward 'em. <hi>Every one that hath forſaken Houſes, or Brethren, or Siſters, or Father, or Mother, or Wife, or Children, or Lands for his Names ſake, being certain to receive an Hundred Fold, and to Inherit Everlaſting Life,</hi> Mat. 19.29.</p>

                        <hi>II.</hi> Hezekiah, to diſcover his Hypocriſy, and to Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him in the ſight thereof.</note>Secondly, We find, <hi>That God Tempted Hezekiah, in order to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to him his own Hypocriſy and Corruption, and the Pride of his own Heart, that he might be humbled in the Sight and Senſe thereof.</hi> For <hi>Hezekiah</hi> being lately Recover'd from a mortal Sickneſs, by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Providence of God: <hi>The Princes of Babylon ſent their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors unto him to enquire of the Wonder, that was done in the Land, and God left him to try him, that he might Know all that was in his Heart,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.31. that is, God did Providentially order the Coming of thoſe Forreign Ambaſſadors upon this Errand, to try <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> whether he would take this occaſion before thoſe Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who put their Truſt in thoſe, which were no Gods, to Glorify the True God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for ſo miraculouſly Recovering of him. But he being more intent upon ſetting out his own Grandeur, than God's Glory, took care only <hi>To ſhew them all the Houſe of his precious Things, the Silver, and the Gold, and the Spices, and the precious Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all the houſe of his Armour, and all the houſe of his Treaſures,</hi> 2 King. 20.13. Upon which God did ſeverely Reprove and Humble him by the Mouth of his Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ver. 17, 18, 19. for ſuch his Ingratitude, Pride, and Vanity. And ſo it is with every one of us. There is a great deal of <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>Vanity,</hi> and other <hi>Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>ſecret Hypocriſies,</hi> which lie lurking in our Hearts; and we our ſelves are Ignorant thereof, and how we ſhall prove, till we are try'd, and ſome Providential Occaſion draws it out: And then if God's Word, or Miniſters, or the Rebukes of our own Conſciences make us ſenſible thereof, we are much Better'd, and God has his Gracious Ends in our Amendment. So that thus you ſee to what good Purpoſes God does <hi>Tempt</hi> us; namely, Either to <hi>prove our Vertue,</hi> that he may Reward us the better for it, or to <hi>diſcover our Hypocriſy</hi> and Inſincerity, that we might be Humbled in the Sight and Sence thereof, and be thereby amended.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And by this very Wile, he to this day,<note place="margin">By theſe Means he brings that Ignorance in Divine Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which reigns in moſt Men's Minds.</note> ſpreads ſuch an Ignorance over the Minds of Men, in matters of Religion, as makes even Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it ſelf ſeem to reign, where the Goſpel has ſo long ſhin'd. For by engaging ſome into nice Enquiries after a Thouſand other things, he draws 'em off from ever looking into their Bibles. And as to Others, by decoying 'em into one Sin after another, he does at length im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their Knowledge of Evil to that degree, that at laſt they come to know nothing of Good; nay, to have ſo little a ſenſe of it, ſuch ſtupify'd Apprehenſions concerning it, as to <hi>Call Evil, Good; and Good, Evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then having once Blindfolded the Reaſon of Man,<note place="margin">And being ſpiritually ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, Men are eaſily led into whatev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Sin and Miſery.</note> with the Ignorance of Divine Things, what Sin and Miſery is there, that Satan does not moſt eaſily lead Men into? For why? Good and Uſeful Knowledge, ſuch as the Knowledge of God, and of our ſelves, and of our Duty to him, is the Eye of the Soul, whereby alone it can ſee its Way, and ſteer its Courſe ſafely towards Heaven: Whereas on the other ſide, <hi>Ignorance of God and Religion,</hi> is the ſame in the Mind, as <hi>Blindneſs</hi> in the Eye; and therefore as a Blind Man may with the greateſt Eaſe be drawn aſide into Pits, and over Rocks, to his Downfal and Deſtruction, and it is next to impoſſible he ſhould ever get ſafe to his Journeys End: ſo an Ignorant Man in Religious Matters, muſt needs be an eaſy Prey to Satan and Falſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, and he cannot poſſibly tell how to ſteer his Courſe ſafe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, but muſt almoſt neceſſarily ſuffer Shipwrack of Body and Soul in Hell. So that this Policy of the Devil, in Corrupting the Underſtanding and Reaſon of Man, by putting him upon curious Enquiries, and a ſinful Experiment, in order as he pretended, to enlarge his Knowledge, but in reallity with a deſign to draw over his Soul a thick Cloud of Ignorance, that ſo he might lead him Blindfold into any Sin and Miſery, is a Depth of Satan that was, and ſtill is moſt Fatal and Deſtructive to our Innocence, and to our Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>And this therefore is another Wile of Satan's,<note place="margin">This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another Wile of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's, which muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoided.</note> which you muſt alſo carefully avoid. You muſt above all things Beware of ever making <hi>Experiments of the Pleaſures of Sin,</hi> vainly deceiving your own Souls with the Expectations, that having once known what is in 'em, you will the more Abhor 'em for the future. Few of thoſe, who do make ſuch ſinful Experiments do afterwards return to a ſound, and ſober Senſe of things. Not that they find any reaſon to ſtick to thoſe Courſes, but becauſe the ways of Sin are meer Mazes, which once Enter'd into, are hardly got out of; and becauſe Sin often committed, does at length ſear the Conſcience, and drives away the Holy Spirit, and ſo the wretched Sinner becomes utterly <hi>Ignorant</hi> of God's Ways, and the Happineſs it would be to him to walk therein. And in this their <hi>Ignorance</hi> what Pits of Deſtruction are there, which Satan cannot draw them into. You muſt therefore, I ſay, above all things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, as to Expel all <hi>Ignorance of Divine Things</hi> out of your Minds: ſo the great Cauſes thereof, of Satan's Contrivance, namely, <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity after vain and unprofitable Things,</hi> which will divert you from what does infinitely more concern you, <hi>viz.</hi> The good State of your
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:151517:127"/> Souls; and you muſt carefully beware of Experimentally knowing Sin, the Commiſſion and Acquaintance with which, will draw a thick Cloud of Ignorance over your Minds, as has been ſpoke. And hereby you will alſo Renounce and Defeat another conſiderable Temptation and Wile of Satan's, to draw us into a Courſe of Sin.</p>

And Satan therefore if he could make ſure to his Party ſuch a Favourite, what might he not obtain of him? He knew it, and therefore he Tempted <hi>Eve</hi> firſt, and by her Importunity, gain'd the Conſent of <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo he alſo Tranſgreſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">And by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we moſt place our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections upon, does he ſtill inveigle us to do what is Forbidden.</note>And the ſame is alſo ſtill his method to ruine us. If there be any thing, which we do particularly place our Affections upon, he will be ſure to Inveigle us by the Perſwaſions of that, to do the forbidden Thing. If <hi>Achan</hi> once begins to ſet his Heart upon the <hi>Wedge of Gold, and the goodly Babyloniſh Garment,</hi> then, tho' it be an <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Thing,</hi> he will put the Diſcovery of it to the Venture. If <hi>Gehazi</hi> once begin to hanker after the <hi>Talent of Silver, and the Two Changes of Raiment,</hi> that ſhall put him upon Lying and Cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to obtain them; <hi>And the love of Money is the root of all Evil,</hi> we are told, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10. And the like may be ſaid of any thing elſe, whatever is our Darling, ſhall be his Inſtrument to Tempt us. And therefore it does nearly concern us, as we will preſerve our ſelves free from the Danger of Satan, and all his ſnares, to have a Jealous Eye upon what we do moſt love, that it do not Entice us into Sin by his Art in managing of it.<note place="margin">And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour would have us bear that Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our neareſt Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as to be able to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them, and their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than God.</note> And therefore does our Saviour Caution us, in ſuch unuſual Terms, againſt Loving too much our very neareſt Relations, telling us, <hi>That if any one come to him, and Hate not his Father and Mother, and Wife and Children, and Brethren and Siſters, yea and his own Life alſo, he cannot be his Diſciple,</hi> Luk. 14.26. that is, he would have us to take care, we bear that Indifferency of Affection towards even our neareſt Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as to be able to Forſake them, and their Intereſts (which they and the World will count Hating of them) rather than depart from God, and loſe his Favour; for that otherwiſe, if we ſet our Hearts too much upon them, they will prove a dangerous Snare to us, and <hi>a Man's greateſt Enemies,</hi> as to his real Injury and Hurt, <hi>will be thoſe of his own Houſe and Family,</hi> becauſe he does moſt love them. It is a very great Temptation to be too warmly Affected towards any thing on this ſide Heaven; Satan will be ſure to Tempt us thereby, if he can, to <hi>Set our Affections, not on things Above, but on things of the Earth,</hi> ſo contrary to what we are commanded, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.2.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:151517:127"/> Reflect the greateſt Diſhonour upon our Maker, Satan did excite their Luſts and Appetites alſo, after the forbidden Fruit, by propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the faireſt Objects, and the moſt delicious Dainties to their Senſes. <hi>And when the Woman ſaw that the Tree was good for Food, and that it was pleaſant to the Eye, ſhe took of the Fruit thereof, and did Eat, and gave alſo unto her Husband with her, and he did Eat,</hi> Gen. 3.6. What could be more Diſhonourable to God, than for Perſons owing their Life and Being, and all that they Enjoy'd to God's Bounty; and living in the midſt of Paradiſe, and having all manner of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Comforts flowing in upon them, ſo little to Value God, and his Favours, as to Sacrifice all their Intereſt in him, for the poor En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of One forbidden Fruit? Was not this to Undervalue him to the loweſt Degree? Why, this Satan did, by propoſing to their Senſes ſuch Objects, as being exceedingly Delightful, and extreamly Pleaſant to Behold and Taſt, might moſt eaſily prevail upon them, to Tranſgreſs their Maker's Laws in obtaining of them.</p>
                  <p>And by the very ſame methods does he prevail to this Day,<note place="margin">And by the ſame methods does he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, to this day, upon the far greateſt part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to Rebel againſt God. For Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made up very much of Senſe, ſo that nothing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the Soul but thro' the Doors of our Senſes, we are eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd upon by what Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> upon the far greateſt Part of Mankind to Rebel againſt God. He was ſo well aſſured of the Efficacy and Power of this Temptation, that he endeavour'd to Overthrow even our Bleſſed Saviour by it. <hi>He takes him up into an exceeding high Mountain, and ſhewing him all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the World, and the Glory of them, he ſaith unto him, All theſe things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me,</hi> Matth. 4.8, 9. But the Second <hi>Adam</hi> being God, as well as Man, could not be Foil'd, tho' the Firſt was ſo eaſily taken with ſenſible Things. But it is not ſo Happy with the reſt of Mankind, who being made up very much of Senſe, ſo that nothing enters into our Souls, but through the Doors of our Senſes, we are by nothing ſo generally prevail'd upon, as by outward Things, and ſuch as pleaſe our Senſes; and therefore the Devil does particularly apply himſelf to Tempt us this way. He preſents Riches, Honours and Pleaſures to our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Senſes, and dazles them with their Glory and Beauty, and by that would Tempt us to purchaſe them at the Price of our Innocence.</p>
                  <p>And indeed the far greateſt part of Sinners are wrought upon to Rebel againſt God, and are made Slaves to <hi>Satan's Kingdom,</hi> by this laſt method of his, <hi>In Tempting our Luſts and Appetites by Senſible and Outward Things.</hi> They are but few in Compariſon, (ſome only of finer Parts and clearer Intellectuals) that are Tempted to Offend God by a <hi>Curioſity of Knowing every thing, tho' uſeleſs and ſinful:</hi> But the far greateſt Part of Mankind are groſs in their Underſtandings, and ſuch Carnally-minded Men place their whole Happineſs in the Enjoyment of ſuch things, as gratify the Bodily Part of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and therefore by the Preſentation of thoſe things to their Senſes, with all the Advantage that Satan has Skill enough to put 'em off withal, their Luſts and Appetites do wholly deſire theſe things.</p>
                  <p>And as Satan does excite our Luſts and Appetites to covet Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things, by whatever pleaſes any of our Senſes;<note place="margin">Eſpecially the Senſes of See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> ſo eſpecially by thoſe Objects that do gratify the Senſes of <hi>Seeing and Taſting:</hi> Hence as to the Luſts of the Eye, <hi>How many look ſo long upon a Woman, till they have committed Adultery with her already in their Hearts?</hi> And as
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:151517:128"/> to our Appetites, How many Belly-Gods, with <hi>Eſau, Sell their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance for a Meſs of Pottage?</hi>

And as to our own <hi>Souls,</hi> Why ſhould ſuch excellent Beings, of ſuch exquiſite Faculties, capable of reliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Pure and Heavenly Joys above, be clogg'd and ſurfeited with thoſe cloying Vanities of this World? Which after they are once Taſted, are ſure to ſit very Heavy, and are never well digeſted by the Mind and Conſcience; and the Soul can never be at Eaſe, till by Confeſſion and other Acts of Repentance, it has thrown 'em up again. But the Vileneſs of thus ſubmitting the Mind to drudge to our Senſes, and to ſtudy only to pleaſe our Luſts and Appetites, will be more properly Expos'd, when we come to ſhew you how far, and in what ſence you are to <hi>Renounce the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh.</hi>

                  <p>To ſumm up then what has been hitherto ſaid concerning thoſe Temptations, and Means whereby at firſt Satan overthrew the whole Race of Mankind; and drew it off from their Obedience to God, to do Service to him, and does ſtill ſo ſucceſsfully Overcome ſo many: Whether it be by infuſing into your Thoughts ill Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of God, particularly of his Juſtice and Mercy; or by diverting of your Minds by needleſs Curioſities, from improving of your Souls in Divine Knowledge; and eſpecially, as is his wont, by ſtupifying of your ſence of Divine Things, by trying what is in ſinful Pleaſures: Or whether he ſhall at any time Tempt you to commit what is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, by the Inveiglements and Enticements of what you do entirely love and affect: Or Laſtly, By propoſing to your Luſts and Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, what is pleaſing to your Senſes. In which of theſe ways ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is, that he attempts you, you muſt ſtoutly reſiſt him. And being he was not ſucceſsful in theſe ways of Temptation againſt our Firſt Parents alone, but has been alſo Vers'd in the ſame for many Thouſand Years ever ſince; and therefore muſt be ſuppos'd to have grown very skilful in the Management of 'em: It does therefore concern you, with more than ordinary Diligence to Guard your ſelves againſt 'em. And in ſo doing you will go a great way towards <hi>Renouncing that great Work of his, his Tempting us to Sin;</hi> concerning which, what is farther to be ſpoke, muſt be defer'd till the next Opportunity.</p>

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:151517:129"/> to his Son to raiſe this Church Militant, immediately after the Fall of Man; and the War between Satan and the Church was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd in theſe Words,<note place="margin">This he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to do in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Abel.</hi>

And no ſooner was this War Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd, but this cruel Murderer, the Devil (for a Murderer he is ſaid to have been from the Beginning) thought to have cut it off at one Blow in the Perſon of <hi>Abel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">And when afterwards Recruited in the Family of <hi>Seth,</hi> yet he Reduc'd it again by the bloody Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Cain,</hi> to Eight Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the days of <hi>Noah</hi>

And tho' God, in the Perſon and Family of <hi>Seth,</hi> did recruit the Church of Chriſt; yet the Poſterity of <hi>Cain,</hi> being a Barbarous and Bloody ſort of Men, did ſo far prevail and bear down all before 'em, that the True Servants of God were reduc'd to the Number of Eight Perſons, and were drove into a very narrow Corner, even into the Compaſs of the Ark. Thus he prevail'd over the Church of God, ſo as almoſt to Extinguiſh it before the Flood.</p>
                  <p>Nor did his Fury burn leſs fiercely againſt it after: For when God giving a <hi>Bill of Divorce</hi> to all the Nations of the Earth,<note place="margin">When after the Flood, God choſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and his Poſterity to be a ſpecial People unto himſelf, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſht that People by his Servant <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh.</hi>
                     </note> who had ſo Vilely play'd the Harlot in ſerving of Idols, that is, Devils, did chooſe <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Poſterity to be a <hi>Special People unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, above all the People that were upon the face of the Earth,</hi> Deut. 7.6. Tho' One would have thought, that Satan might have been contented with ſuch large ſpoils, as all the Kingdoms of the World beſides; and that, as he had little reaſon to Envy the Maker of all Things, the faithful Allegiance of ſuch a handful of Men, as were the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in compariſon of the reſt of the World: So he would let God alone with 'em. Yet ſo it was, that from the firſt Infancy of the Jewiſh Church (when by <hi>Pharaoh</hi> he endeavour'd utterly to have extinguiſht that People, cauſing all their Male-Children to be ſlain by the Order of that Bloody Tyrant) till the time of our Saviour's coming into the Fleſh; we find it to have been his continual Exerciſe, to ſtir up the Potentates of the Earth againſt it:<note place="margin">And in all Periods till our Saviour's coming, he ſtir'd up the Idolatrous Nations their Neighbours, eſpecially the Four Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs them.</note> And there is hardly a Period of Time to be found, but either he ſtir'd up the Neighbouring Nations, eſpecially the Four Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies of the World, mention'd <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. to Moleſt, Harraſs, and to Captivate 'em; or Inſtigated their own Kings, to Perſecute and deſtroy thoſe, that would remain the Worſhipers of the One True God.</p>
                  <p>But above all did Satan then Exert his Malice, ſoon after that our Saviour came amongſt us, and that Chriſtianity began to take Footing in the World; when, as God's Goodneſs to Mankind did moſt wonderfully appear in this their Deliverance; ſo did Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's Envy and Fury burn ſo much the fiercer againſt both God, and Man. To his infinite ſorrow he found himſelf diſpoſſeſt of a great Part of Mankind,<note place="margin">But ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Chriſt appeared in the World, did he moſt Vigorouſly exert his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt it.</note> over which he had born before ſo abſolute a ſway. He ſaw his Altars thrown down, his Superſtitious Myſteries derided, his Magical Arts diſcover'd, and the Kingdom of Light ſhining thro' his Kingdom of Darkneſs, and Expoſing it to the publick View and Scorn of the World; and this was a Hell to him, as bad, as that to which he is to be for ever Chain'd, and he call'd it a <hi>Torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him before his time,</hi> Matth. 8.29. No ſooner therefore did God out of Pity to the whole Race of Man, whom he beheld holden in miſerable Bondage to Satan, ſend his own Son <hi>To preach Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:151517:131"/> and in raiſing Prejudices in the Minds of Chriſtians againſt <hi>Forms of Prayer,</hi> as not Spiritual enough, if at all Lawful.

And this conſider'd, if Prayers of other Godly Men's; nay, of a whole Church's compoſing, muſt not be Us'd; does it not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow, that this Principal of all <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> of all <hi>Natural Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> muſt ſuffer, if not a total Neglect, at leaſt-wiſe, that it muſt be very indecently and rudely Perform'd, and in too familiar a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with God, as is too uſual? Why, woful Experience does plainly ſhew us, that for this very Reaſon it does. And therefore,<note place="margin">By this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Means, Satan has ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Helps we have in our Church, and brought in a great Neglect of Publick, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> tho' no Church, through the Care of its Pious Biſhops, and Paſtors, did ever Abound with more excellent Forms and Helps, and thoſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fitted for <hi>Publick, Family,</hi> and <hi>Private Devotion,</hi> than our Church does at this Day; yet upon the account of Men's Prejudices, which they have been taught to Entertain againſt Forms of Prayer, as not Lawful, or not Expedient, or not Spiritual enough; never did Perſons ſo ſadly Profane the Worſhip and Service of God, ſo heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly join in the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> ſo ſcandalouſly throw aſide <hi>Family Religion,</hi> and ſo univerſally, I fear, neglect <hi>Private Devotion,</hi> as now they do. I fear, that thoſe who ſo zealouſly decry Forms of Prayer, and that on purpoſe to Advance in its ſtead a more Spiritual way of Worſhip, as they think, will take it ill, that their darling Opinion ſhould be Entituled to the Policy of ſo ill an Author; but, if conſidering the Miſchief, together with the Cunning there does appear upon Examination, to be in Satan's Contrivances to Ruine Religion, and to draw us off from God; we may ſafely Conjecture any Doctrine, that is Pernicious in its Effects, when Plauſible in its Appearance, to be of his Invention: ſurely that, which under the Colour of Advancing a more Spiritual Worſhip, does ſo fatally deſtroy all Religious Worſhip, has another Spirit for its Author, than is commonly Pretended.</p>
                  <p>And thus you may perceive, by theſe few Inſtances, whereby you may be enabled to make a happy Conjecture concerning the reſt, how Cunningly Satan does Gild over, and Diſguiſe his Errors with ſomething of a Reſemblance to Divine Truth, in order to prevent their Diſcovery: And this he does, eſpecially in thoſe Countries and Churches, where Men do <hi>Thirſt</hi> after Divine Knowledge, and to that End do <hi>Search the Scriptures.</hi> The Devil's main and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Care indeed, is to keep out the Word of God from ſhining upon any People; and at firſt he bends all his Forces to keep off the Preachers of it, that ſo the World being detain'd in Ignorance, they may not know how to Repent and Return to God: But when the Light of his Holy Goſpel does once begin to ſhine upon any People, then all his Endeavours are to Corrupt and Deprave it with falſe and forc'd Explications, and to multiply Controverſies and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Religious Matters, to teach Men to Scruple every Thing, and out of a ſcrupulous Humour, to divide and ſub-divide into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Sects and Parties, ſtirring up each to Perſecute and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the other; that whilſt the different Parties contend ſo furiouſly
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:151517:132"/> with one another, he may ſecurely Triumph over all, and bring the Holy Scriptures at laſt into Contempt with Prophane and Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Men: As if they were the Occaſion of all thoſe Wars and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions, that are occaſion'd in the World by Religious Diſputes; when alas! He alone, by managing the Luſts and corrupt Humours of ſinful Men, is the cauſe thereof. So St. <hi>Jude,</hi> ver. 19. <hi>Theſe be they who ſeparate themſelves, Senſual, having not the Spirit.</hi> They have not the Holy Spirit of God, tho' no none make more confident Boaſts thereof, than Schiſmaticks and Separatiſts uſually do: But the Spirit, which they have, is the Spirit of Satan, and of Senſuality, whatever Godlineſs and Purity above other Men they pretend to.</p>

                  <p>In the dark and ignorant Ages of the Church, which were from about the Ninth Century, till towards the time of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when Men's Studies and Diſpoſitions ſavour'd wholly of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition;</hi> we hear of nothing ſo much in the Stories of thoſe Times,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:151517:132"/> as of the Apparitions and Viſions,<note place="margin">Hence in dark and ignorant Ages, nothing ſo common as the Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Saints, as was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the belief of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage-Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the like Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> that the Founders of their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Orders, and ſuperſtitious Doctrines did receive: Inſomuch, that no New Order of Monks and Fryars, nor any New Doctrine of Purgatory, Image-worſhip, Prayers to Saints, or any Pilgrimage to the Shrine of ſome Saint departed, was to be Invented; but either the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or ſome other Saint, is ſaid to have Appear'd, and to have Appointed it. And as Legendary and Fabulous, as were the Hiſtories of thoſe Times, I am apt to Believe there were ſuch Apparitions, as I am throughly perſwaded, that <hi>Samuel</hi> did Appear to <hi>Saul:</hi> But then, as it was not really <hi>Samuel</hi> himſelf, for his Body was in the Grave, and his Soul in Paradiſe (and it was not in the Power of the <hi>Witch of Endor,</hi> to Raiſe up the One from the Duſt, much leſs to Recal the Other out of Heaven;) but the Devil, who did aſſume <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Shape: So it is more than probable, he might appear in the Reſemblance of the Bleſſed Virgin, and Others, to ſeduce the ſuperſtitious People of thoſe Times into Idolatrous Practices, who throwing aſide the Scriptures, <hi>Gave heed to Fables and Doctrines of Devils.</hi> It was infinitely then the Intereſt of his Kingdom ſo to do.</p>

                     <hi>They are deceitful Workers,</hi> Teaching the Doctrines of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by Halves, ſometimes Advancing Morality, and a Virtuous

And to the End they may be the better fitted to Deceive, he is not wanting to <hi>Furniſh out his Inſtruments with all the moſt plauſible Arts of Deceiving.</hi> And their deceitful Working is uſually in the very ſame manner as the Devil's was. That wicked Spirit would have Tempted our Saviour deſperately to throw himſelf down from the Pinacle of the Temple, and to preſume upon God's working of a Miracle to preſerve him in ſo doing. And to Encourage him therein, he quotes a Text of Scripture, which is in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.11, 12. <hi>For he ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, and they ſhall bear thee up in their hands, leſt thou daſh thy Foot againſt a Stone.</hi> In the Quotation of which Place of Scripture, you may obſerve, he leaves out what makes againſt him, which are theſe Words, <hi>To keep thee in all his ways.</hi> The Words entire are, <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all his ways;</hi> meaning, That ſo long as a Man keeps himſelf in the Ways of God, and in the Uſe of thoſe due Means, which he has preſcrib'd; he will not fail to Preſerve him. And in the very ſame manner do moſt Heretical Deceivers delude the World. They will pretend the higheſt Veneration and Reſpect for Scripture, and none are ſo apt to quote it for every Thing they ſay, as they: But then if you obſerve them, they either leave out ſuch Expreſſions, as make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, or conſider not the Scope and Meaning thereof, with reference to the Context and Meaning of the fore-going and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, or they put ſome forc'd and violent Interpretation upon 'em, not at all agreeable to the meaning thereof in that Place Thus they are <hi>Deceitful Workers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, <hi>They will Transform themſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt,</hi> putting on the Garb and outward Appearance of Apoſtolick Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Graces, when they go forth into the World to diſperſe theſe their Errors. Indeed Satan is careful to furniſh thoſe, whom he ſends out, with <hi>ſuitable and agreeable Qualities,</hi> according to the Nature of thoſe Errors they are to ſow in the World. If their Buſineſs is to undermine the Faith of Chriſtians, to diſparage the more myſterious Doctrines of Chriſtianity, of a <hi>Trinity of Perſons in one Divine Nature,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Such as place all Religion in Morality, ſhall be ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</note> and of the <hi>Divinity and Satisfaction of Chriſt,</hi> and to place the whole of the Chriſtian Religion in Morality, and a Good Life; why then he will adorn his Agents with the fair and plauſible Vertues of Humanity, and Courteſy, and Civility of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which are moſt taking amongſt Perſons of better Quality, the likelieſt Soil to ſow Heterodox Opinions of that Nature in.</p>
                  <p>But on the other ſide, Is it his Deſign to ſtarve that Part of Chriſtianity, which conſiſts in the Practice of moral Vertues, and to Repreſent it all as <hi>Myſtery?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Such as turn it all into My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, ſhall be Gifted with Canting.</note> Why then his Agents ſhall have the Gift of Uttering themſelves in Canting Phraſes, and obſcure and dark Forms of Expreſſions, that ſeem to have ſomething of My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriouſneſs in them.

And this is an extraordinary Reach in Satan. That impure Spirit is ſometimes content, that ſome of his principal Agents ſhould not be immorally Wicked; for by few ſuch Men's ſeeming Godlineſs, he Propagates thoſe dangerous and deſtructive Principles, which will make Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes become ſecurely, and without <hi>Remorſe of Conſcience,</hi> Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainouſly Wicked.</p>
                  <p>And now there is not a greater Difficulty perhaps in the whole Chriſtian Warfare,<note place="margin">
                        <p>The moſt difficult Part of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's Warfare is to preſerve One ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted with Heretical Pravity, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd over with the Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Truth.</p>

                  <p>But however, as difficult as it is, no honeſt Mind, that will be careful to weigh thoſe Poiſonous Doctrines, and the Perſons who Propagate them in the <hi>Ballance of the Sanctuary;</hi> that is, by thoſe Rules, which the Scripture has given us: But may be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Lightneſs and Vanity of both, and ſo to <hi>Renounce</hi> both one and the other. And that which every one is to do, that he may <hi>Renounce them,</hi> is not to be too eaſy in Entertaining 'em, becauſe Plauſible at firſt appearance; but impartially to <hi>Try</hi> and Examine, by a true and infallible Touch-ſtone, both their Doctrines, and thoſe who Propagate them, whether they <hi>Be of God.</hi> Thus we are directed, 1 Joh. 4.5. <hi>Beloved, Believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits, whether they are of God, becauſe many falſe Prophets are gone out into the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And how ſhall you do this? Why the Scripture does give you Two moſt infallible and plain Rules whereby to do it. The one <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.16. The other the Verſe immediately following the now cited Place of St. <hi>John.</hi> That in <hi>Matthew</hi> is this,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> By its Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to an Ill Life.</note> 
                     <hi>You ſhall know them by their Fruits.</hi> If their Doctrines are apt to infuſe into your Minds any unworthy and undue Thoughts of God, or any Seeds of Impiety, Injuſtice, Uncleanneſs, Uncharitableneſs, Sedition, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, in a word, if they do Countenance any Immorality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> By its Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off from our Depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon the Mediation of Chriſt, for the Acceptance of a good One.</note> Let their Pretences and Carriage be never ſo fair and free from Scandal, to be ſure they are <hi>Falſe Prophets,</hi> and the Devil's Agents. The Rule given us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.2, 3. whereby to diſcover the Doctrines of Satan's infuſing, is this; <hi>Hereby know ye the Spirit of God; every Spirit that confeſſeth not that Jeſus Chriſt is come into the Fleſh, is not of God.</hi> By Jeſus Chriſt being come in the Fleſh, is meant, that Jeſus Chriſt took our Nature upon him, that he might be a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:151517:134"/> betwixt God and Us, to Reconcile the Father to us, by his Satisfaction and Interceſſion for us. And whoſoever ſhall teach contrary to this, ſo as to take off our Dependance upon Chriſt, let him ſeem never ſo Zealous for a Good Life, his Doctrine is of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's deviſing.</p>
                  <p>The whole Deſign of Chriſtianity is, no doubt, as appears from theſe Two former Rules, to make us Holy in this World; and yet withal to create in us ſuch a Dependance and Reliance on Chriſt for Salvation, as to expect it, not on the account of our own Holy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, which are ſo imperfect, but in the Vertue of Chriſt's Mediation with the Father for us. And whoſoever will but care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Examine the ſeveral falſe Doctrines, ſo much Preacht up at this Day by our Enemies on either ſide, by theſe Two Rules, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Deſign of Chriſtianity,</hi> I am verily perſwaded, will find moſt of them to thwart one Part, or other of this Deſign; and that either they diſcourage Holineſs, or if they ſeem to ſtand upon the Neceſſity thereof, they decry the Neceſſity of our Dependance upon Chriſt's Mediation for God's Acceptance of it to our Juſtification; and ſo by one, or other of theſe Rules, we may diſcover them to be Doctrines of Satan's infuſing. Moſt of the Doctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do plainly tend to make Men ſecure in a Courſe of Sin; and thoſe <hi>Antinomian</hi> Tenets, wherewith ſome of our Diſſenting Brethren are too much in Love, do alſo tend to the ſame, cauſing us to depend ſo entirely on Chriſt's ſatisfaction, as to make us neglect the <hi>Working out our own Salvation:</hi> On the contrary, the <hi>Socinian,</hi> at the ſame time he pretends much for Morality, and a Good Life, denies the Sacrifice and Satisfaction of Chriſt, and that God the Father gave him to be an <hi>Attonement</hi> for the Sins of Mankind, and in the Vertue of his precious Blood, to intercede in Heaven for our Reconciliation; ſo that he wholly takes off our Faith, or Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on Chriſt for Juſtification. Thus may the moſt dangerous Errors, now in the Church of Chriſt, with a little Watchfulneſs and Care to examine the Tendency of them, be diſcover'd by you, from whoſe Suggeſtions they proceed, and that they are <hi>Tares of the Enemies,</hi> that is, the Devil's <hi>ſowing, whilſt the Husbandman was aſleep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But do you, I beſeech you, carefully beware of ſuch falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and deceitful Teachers; both which are Satan's Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to draw you unwittingly to ſin againſt, and diſhonour God: And tho' his Agents ſeem never ſo Demure, and appear never ſo Sanctify'd, who do teach Men ſuch Doctrines; <hi>Beware of thoſe Wolves, who come to you in Sheeps cloathing, you ſhall know them by their Fruits.</hi> If they ſhall endeavour to inſtil into your Minds, any undue Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, contrary to what you are taught out of the Scripture, in the Doctrine of our Church; or any pernicious Opinions, that in their Nature and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency ſhall render an Holy, Good Life unneceſſary to our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; aſſure your ſelves they are no <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt,</hi> but of Satan: And are ſet on work by him to deſtroy God's Authority, amongſt Men, and to ſet up his own Laws in their Hearts, the Thing he aims at. And ſo much for this Time.</p>

                  <p>THE Point that we are now upon, is to make as full a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery to you, as here we can, of that Great <hi>Work of the Devil, his Tempting us to Sin:</hi> A Work ſo eminently the Buſineſs and Employment of Satan, and ſo dangerous and Deſtructive to Mankind, and alſo manag'd in ſuch manifold and cunning Methods, that it ought particularly to be conſider'd by us. <q>The Devil, ſays a Father, has nothing elſe that he does, but Tempt us to Sin; He neither Eats, nor Drinks, nor Sleeps, nor does he any thing elſe but Tempt, Deceive, and Subvert us. This is his Meat, this is his Honour, this is his Joy. In this he is Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable, and if he could have his Will, he would never ceaſe Tempting us, but that he is reſtrain'd by the Power of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now in order to the Countermining and Defeating this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous <hi>Work</hi> of his: Firſt, having ſhew'd you, by what Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Means he Overthrew the whole Race of Mankind, and drew it off from Obedience to God, to do Service to him: And, Secondly, Having alſo laid before you, ſuch Temptations as he Levels againſt the Church of Chriſt, the true Servants of God, either utterly to deſtroy 'em, or to Corrupt their Religion, that by that they might Diſhonour their Maker.</p>

                     <hi>That next to his Deſtroying and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of whole Churches, his great Induſtry is to gain over to his Party, or to Tempt to ſome grievous and ſcandalous Enormity, ſuch Perſons, as are more than ordinarily Eminent for their Rank, or Quality, their Order, or their Piety in the Church of God.</hi>

And hence, as in that long Catalogue of the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> how few were there, who were not Idolaters, and highly Infamous for ſome high Abomination, or other? So, ſince the World became Chriſtian, how many <hi>Kings of the Earth</hi> are there, <hi>who have Committed Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> that is, Idolatry with the Whore of <hi>Babylon, and liv'd De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:151517:135"/> with her,</hi> and how will both they, and the <hi>Merchants of the Earth, weep and mourn over her,</hi> when her Calamities come upon her, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.9.11. It is Aſtoniſhing to conſider how, that ſo many of the Honourable, and the Rich, who of all Men living are Oblig'd to be Grateful to God, for ſo many extraordinary Favours and Bleſſings, which they enjoy above other Men, ſhould yet carry it ſo inſolently againſt their Great Benefactor, lifting up their Heads above the Heavens,<note place="margin">Such Men's wickedneſs not altogether from the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptingneſs of Riches, but the Induſtry of Satan, to get over ſuch leading Men to his Party.</note> as it were, Trampling under Foot all Laws, both Divine and Humane; and both in Word and Deed denying and diſowning any Powers above 'em. Why, this is not altogether from the Temptingneſs of Greatneſs and Riches, which it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, are alone a very conſiderable Temptation; but alſo from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's more than ordinary Induſtry to gain over to his Party and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, ſuch Men above all others. For why? Theſe are <hi>Generals,</hi> and <hi>Great Officers,</hi> as it were, in the <hi>Church Militant;</hi> and theſe therefore, if they can be but Prevail'd upon to Revolt from God, all the Herd of Mankind beſides will in a manner follow of Courſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Such Men's Examples, if bad, of malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, becauſe Conſpicuous.</note>There is indeed (Satan does very well know it) nothing that has a more malignant Influence upon the Lives and Manners of Men, than the lewd and profligate Courſes of thoſe, who are <hi>Eminent in Quality, or Power.</hi> Their Examples are doubtleſs of vaſt importance. As in this World they live in a Croud all their Life: So they paſs not into the other, without a Train of Followers at their Heels. If their Examples are extraordinarily Good, they bring many to Heaven along with 'em; if they have been Vicious and Naughty, whole Troops follow to Hell after them; for Subjects, Children, Servants, Dependants, all take after their Lord and Maſter, except it be very rarely:<note place="margin">And will bring upon 'em the Guilt, not only of their own, but of other Men's Sins, becauſe</note> So that thoſe, who abound either in Wealth, or Honour, and do therefore think they have a greater Priviledge to Sin than others, becauſe they have greater Temptations to it, than other Men, are miſerably miſtaken; for as their Lives being pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and conſpicuous, lie more open to the Obſervation and Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, and therefore do cauſe more to Sin: So they ſhall not have their own only, but the Sins of others (ſo far as they have influenc'd 'em to) to anſwer for.</p>
                  <p>And the Reaſon hereof is this: The Actions of Great Men have ſome Force of a Precept with 'em, as well as of a Pattern;<note place="margin">Their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have the force of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, as well as of a Pattern, which Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors are afraid to ſhew their diſlike of.</note> For as One well obſerves, Thoſe who are much Ey'd, cannot ſin ſingly, both becauſe Men of weaker Minds, and leſs Conſideration, look upon them as the great Maſters of Knowledge, and Bravery, and therefore ſtrive to imitate, and be like them: And alſo, becauſe they have many Dependants, that hope to receive ſomething from them, and to be ſome way Better'd by them; and this they cannot hope to be, except they Copy out their Examples, and ſhew their Love and Honour, or rather Flattery to them, in endeavouring what they can to be like them. And therefore we do commonly ſee the Generality, upon any Change, are ready to take up with the Religion, or Tranſcribe the Pattern, and Ape the Actions and Vices of their Prince, or other Governour; and their Faults, as well as Habits, ſhall become the Faſhion of their Country: So that an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy Prince, ſhall ſeldom have a Religious People; a Debaucht Nobility and Gentry, a Devout and Orderly Neighbourhood and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:151517:135"/> Family; a Wicked Father, Pious Children; or an Evil Maſter, Good Servants: But their Actions have the Force, not only of a Pattern, but alſo of a Rule and Law, which Inferiors and Dependants are affraid to go againſt. So that it is not to be wonder'd, that the Devil ſhould be more than ordinarily induſtrious, to gain over to his Party, ſuch as are moſt Eminent for their <hi>Station</hi> and <hi>Quality.</hi> (One ſuch tall <hi>Cedar</hi> ſweeps away with him in his Fall, all the lower Shrubs within the reach of its Branches.)</p>
                  <p>But then it does infinitely concern Perſons of Quality,<note place="margin">Great Men therefore muſt, of all others, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Temptations of Satan.</note> of all Men Living, utterly to Renounce the Ways of Sin, becauſe their ill Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are of ſuch Bad and <hi>malignant Influence</hi> upon others. And they ſhould <hi>Renounce</hi> all the ways of Scandalous and Notorious ill Living, as they are Influential upon others, not only for the ſake of other Men, but alſo for their own dear ſakes. For alas! If a Man's own ſingle Sins, unrepented of, will Plunge him into the Lake of Fire and Brimſtone; how Deep into the bottomleſs Pit muſt they ſink, who have, beſides their own Perſonal Tranſgreſſions, the Sins of many others preſſing 'em Downwards, and loading 'em with all the Curſes of Hell for the ill Example, and other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to Wickedneſs, which they gave 'em? So that it concerns the Great Ones, of all others, to look to their Ways, and vigourouſly to <hi>Renounce</hi> and Reſiſt the Temptations of Satan to Sin and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The Devil is alſo wonderfully Induſtrious to Tempt into ſome ſcandalous Sin, or wicked Courſe of Life; or at leaſt-wiſe to Invent and Propagate ſome ſcandalous Story, againſt ſuch as are Eminent on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Order;</hi> viz. <hi>The Miniſters of Religion.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> Such as are moſt Eminent on the account of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>viz.</hi> the Miniſters of Religion.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>We of the Sacred Function are deſign'd in a more Eminent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it muſt be confeſt, to be the <hi>Light of the World,</hi> to be <hi>Candles ſet, not under a Buſhel, but on a Candleſtick, that we may give Light to all that are in the Houſe:</hi> So that if he can draw a thick Cloud of Ignorance over our Underſtandings, and bring Immorality into our Practice, what he may do with the reſt of Mankind, who are to be Guided by us, he does Rationally enough Conclude. He is indeed doubly Enrag'd againſt us, both becauſe we are the Men, who in the very Nature and Deſign of our Office, are to Deſtroy his Kingdom; and becauſe the reſt of the World do altogether Eye us for their Pattern:<note place="margin">
                        <p>He is doubly Enrag'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch, both becauſe in the Nature and Deſign of their Office, they are to deſtroy his Kingdom, &amp; becauſe the reſt of the World do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together Eye them for their Pattern.</p>
                        <p>Hence no Temptation left untried, to withdraw ſuch into ſome ſcandalous Enormity.</p>
                     </note> Inſomuch, that they are generally more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenc'd by our Lives, than by our Doctrine; and are exceedingly ſcandaliz'd, ſo as to think they may Sin with Allowance and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, if we our ſelves ſhall happen in the leaſt to miſcarry. For theſe Reaſons there are no <hi>Wiles,</hi> nor <hi>Artifices,</hi> nor <hi>prevailing Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> left untry'd, whereby Satan does not Attempt to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the Miniſters of Religion into ſome ſcandalous and enormous Crimes; ſo that when any of the Holy Order happen to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in a Fault, it is not ſo much to be wonder'd at, as having not only the ſame Natural Infirmities with other Men, but far more furious Aſſaults made upon 'em, to Overcome 'em: That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there are ſo many ſhining Lights, as this Church and Nation may juſtly Glory in having at this Day, is becauſe <hi>We are kept by the Power of God to Salvation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.15. But that a Miniſter of Religion ſhould ſometimes Fall, as well others, and that very foully too, is
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:151517:136"/> not to be Admir'd at, much leſs made a matter of Reproach to the whole Order, as it commonly is; ſince our Saviour himſelf told <hi>Peter, Behold Satan hath a Deſire to have you,</hi> (you above all Others) <hi>that he may ſift you as Wheat,</hi> Luk. 22.31. And he did ſift that great Apoſtle to the Purpoſe; inſomuch, that he did wilfully. Deny his Maſter Thrice.</p>
                  <p>And indeed the more Eminently Induſtrious any Miniſter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is found in the Advancement of Chriſt's Kingdom, the more Induſtrious is Satan to Overcome him.<note place="margin">And hence the more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious a Miniſter is, the more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious is Satan to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome him.</note> Hence without doubt it was, that he ſingled out, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> you ſee before, ſo St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſending his <hi>Meſſenger,</hi> One of his Black Angels, <hi>to Buffet him,</hi> as you will ſee, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. True it is, God in his wiſe and good Providence did order that Temptation of Satan's to a good End, and to the Advantage and Security of that Apoſtle: For he <hi>Gave him a Thorn in the Fleſh,</hi> and permitted Satan's <hi>Meſſenger to Buffet him, leſt he ſhould be Exalted above meaſure,</hi> or to keep him Humble. But Satan no doubt did intend thereby (however his Deſigns were Over-rul'd by the Divine Providence, as is moſt uſual) to Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw St. <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe he was in <hi>Labours more abundant, in Stripes above meaſure, in Priſons more frequent,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.23. that is, more Induſtrious in Propagating the Goſpel than others, and came not a Whit <hi>Behind the very chiefeſt of the Apoſtles,</hi> ver. 5.</p>
                  <p>And in the very way, that ſuch are moſt Serviceable to the Church of God, Satan does ſo order it,<note place="margin">And in the very way wherein he is moſt ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Church of God, Satan does endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make him moſt Miſchievous.</note> that they ſhall be Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported beyond the <hi>Bounds of Moderation</hi> and Sobriety, (wherein, for the moſt part, the Vertue does lye) into ſuch Exceſſes, as are <hi>Sinful Enormities.</hi> Thus, is any One Zealous in the Cauſe of God againſt Sin and Wickedneſs, the wicked One will over-heat this Zeal into Cenſoriouſneſs and Bitterneſs, into Fierceneſs and Cruelty, and very often into Faction and Schiſm. Again does he find a Perſon more than ordinarily Mortify'd, and Devout and Heavenly-minded; much given to Faſting and Prayer? Then will he be buiſy to let down into the Fancy of ſuch a One,<note place="margin">As by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Zeal into Faction.</note> deluding Imaginations, and will tempt him by the ſweetneſs of thoſe <hi>Incombs,</hi> and <hi>Indwellings of the Spirit,</hi> as he thinks 'em, to lay aſide the plain and eaſy Rule of God's Holy Word, as a <hi>dead Letter,</hi> and not Spiritual enough; and to give himſelf up to the Guidance of the Impulſes of a <hi>Spirit within him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm.</note> as if they were immediate Inſpirations from God: By which ſond Pretenſions of Men, deluded by Satan, infinite Prejudice is done to Chriſtianity, and occaſion given to Profane Wits to deride real Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, as Cheat and Impoſture, of which we have lately ſeen a moſt ſad Inſtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">If he cannot prevail over him by real Miſ-carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, he will render him uſeleſs by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</note>But if this ſubtle Adverſary, with all his Wiles and Artifices, cannot prevail over the <hi>Man of God,</hi> but that ſtill he is Baffled in all his Attempts upon him; then he ſets his Agents, Slanderers, and Whiſperers on work, (for that their <hi>Tongues are ſet on Fire of Hell,</hi> the Scripture tells us, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.6.) to invent and propagate Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals concerning him. And he does inſpire the Calumniator to raiſe thoſe falſe and injurious Reports, either purely by inventing 'em, without Ground, and thus even our Bleſſed Saviour was accus'd as an <hi>Enemy to Caeſar,</hi> and a <hi>Sabbath-breaker,</hi> or by miſ-interpreting of an innocent Behaviour and Action, as a ſcandalous Crime. And
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:151517:136"/> thus again was the Son of God himſelf, and <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, and thus very frequently are the ſucceeding Miniſters of Religion injur'd to this Day. <hi>The Son of Man came Eating and Drinking,</hi> that is, He affected nothing ſingular, nor differing from other Men in indifferent things, and they ſay, <hi>Behold a man Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonous and a Wine-bibber, a Friend of Publicans and Sinners,</hi> Matth. 11.19. On the other ſide, <hi>John came neither Eating, nor Drinking,</hi> uſed extraordinary Faſtings above other Men, <hi>and they ſay he hath a Devil,</hi> ver. 18. And ſo it alſo fares with the ſucceeding Miniſters of Religion. Is any One of a free, cheerful and ſociable Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and does not wholly abſtain from appearing in Company? Then he is a Drunkard. Is he Frugal, and not given to Profuſe Living? Then he is Covetous. Is he Conſcientious in maintaining the Dues of his Church, and will not ſuffer 'em to be Loſt or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded by the Sacriledge of Covetous Worldlings? Then he is Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigious and given to Law, he is Covetous, and what not? So ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Induſtrious, are Satan and his Agents, to Blacken the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Miniſters of <hi>True Religion,</hi> (I ſay of <hi>True Religion,</hi> for you may always obſerve with what Induſtry the real Vices of thoſe, who are <hi>Miniſters in Hereſy and Schiſm,</hi> are kept ſecret.) And the only Reaſon thereof is this, to leſſen the Authority of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Example in the World, that they ſhould not do that Good, that otherwiſe they might.</p>
                  <p>It does in Truth ſo exceedingly concern the Intereſt of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, that the Reputation of its Miniſters ſhould be preſerv'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully'd;<note place="margin">It wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Concerns the Interest of Religion, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of its Miniſters be kept unfully'd.</note> and ſo injurious to Religion it ſelf, are the Defamations of ſuch Perſons, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was careful to warn <hi>Timothy,</hi> that <hi>againſt an Elder,</hi> that is, againſt a Miniſter, <hi>He ſhould not receive an Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under Two, or Three Witneſſes,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.19. Tho' a ſingle Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that was Credible, was ſufficient againſt any other Perſon: But ſo much, on the contrary, it is to the Advancement of Satan's Kingdom,<note place="margin">Hence Satan and Satani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal men ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious to blaſt it.</note> and ſo Satanically are the greateſt Part of the World diſpos'd, that a vilifying Story, or a ſcandalous Report againſt them, is more readily invented, more eaſily heard, and ſooner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, nay, without any Ground at all ſurmis'd, than againſt any other Perſon whatſoever. But let me tell you, that no good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, that deſires the Deſtruction of Satan's, and the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt's Kingdom in the World, will be forward to hear, much leſs to Believe and Propagate Defamations of the Clergy; as knowing it is the Policy of Satan, to put it into the Hearts of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable Spirits to ſurmiſe, and raiſe, and aggravate little vilify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stories of thoſe in Holy Orders, as of ſome Indiſcretion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: This to make 'em cheap, and more ſcandalous, and falſe Reports of Debauchery and Immorality, to render 'em Odious in the World; and both on purpoſe to render their Labours and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours uſeleſs and ineffectual, to the Reformation and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort: Satan matters it not ſo much, whether by real Sin, or by ſlanderous Reports, he leſſens the Authority and Influence of the <hi>Clergy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">And ſlander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reports leſſen the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Influence of the Clergy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as much as real Sin.</note> his Avow'd Enemies, whoſe peculiar Buſineſs it is to deſtroy his Uſurpt Dominion, and to Propagate the Kingdom of God in the World. By real Sins indeed, he would rather chooſe, if he
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:151517:137"/> could, and does therefore mainly Endeavour to have the Clergy Blemiſht; but meerly by raiſing the Scandal, be it as well Falſe, as True, he gains his End, according to <hi>Machiavel,</hi> his great Secretary's Maxim, <hi>Fortiter accuſare &amp; aliquid adherebit:</hi> Throw Dirt upon a Man, and the Stain will in ſome meaſure ſtick. Such is the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious Humour of the World, as to think there muſt be ſomething in it, when a Slander is broacht; and ſo maliciouſly are wicked Men bent againſt the Miniſters of Religion eſpecially, as greedily to ſwallow every thing, that tends to leſſen their Reputation. In a word, By both he gains his End, which is, to have Religion it ſelf wounded, through the ſides of its Miniſters. And whether any of 'em ſhall really miſ-carry, or be falſly Defam'd for ſo doing, he knows, the World upon either account will <hi>Abhor the Offerings of the Lord,</hi> and even a meer Slander will be ſuch a ſtumbling Block to many, <hi>As to make the Lord's people to tranſgreſs.</hi>

                        </p>
                     </note> that they will Triumph in it, and cry down all Religion for <hi>Hypocriſy,</hi> when they ſee its greateſt Examples commit any thing that is ill. This the Devil knows very well, and withal, that after ſuch a Fall, the <hi>Laps'd</hi> Perſon ſhall be render'd almoſt incapable ever after of Converting others by his Example, or Exhortations. For as to his Example, tho' he Repent never ſo heartily, and recover his former State with Advantage; yet it will be a continual Blot in his Scutcheon, that he did ſo and ſo, like that, <hi>Excepting the matter of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> was in <hi>David</hi>'s. And as for his Exhortations, let him be who
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:151517:137"/> he will, whether Miniſter, Magiſtrate, Parent, or Maſter, that goes about to Reprove and Admoniſh others; the Criminal, inſtead of being Convinc'd and Better'd thereby, will preſently Return upon him in Thought at leaſt-wiſe, if not in Word, with a Why did you do ſo your ſelf? And now for theſe Reaſons, I ſay, the Devil lays a cloſe Siege againſt a Perſon of Exemplary Piety and Goodneſs. As for thoſe, who are already Vicious, he reckons himſelf ſecure of them; ſo he does not ſo much concern himſelf about them: He only throws a Temptation now and then into their way, leaving 'em for the moſt part to follow the Bent of their own Inclinations: But againſt this <hi>Bulwark</hi> of Religion, a Perſon of bright and ſhining Graces, he draws up all his Artillery,<note place="margin">Againſt this Bulwark of Religion therefore the Devil draws up all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery.</note> and levels all his Inſtruments of Battery. Thus he attackt Holy <hi>Job,</hi> when he found that Proſperity would not corrupt him, he goes another way to work, and with unheard-of Afflictions, one following upon the heels of another, he endeavour'd to force him to Blaſpheme his Maker, and deſperately to <hi>Curſe God and dye.</hi> He is a great Maſter of Politicks, and therefore takes ſuch Meaſures as a Crafty General in the Conqueſt of an Enemies Country. A wiſe Commander will always lye down the before Place of greateſt Conſequence, and upon the Taking of which the reſt will fall in of Courſe; ſo the Devil, his great Attempt is to Foil an exemplary Pattern of Religion, whoſe Fall he thinks will ſhrewdly ſtagger many others.</p>
                  <p>But the inceſſant Induſtry of Satan to overcome a more than ordinary Piety, and the Pride he takes therein,<note place="margin">The Pride and Pains he takes in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſuch a One, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in a Parable.</note> I cannot better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to you, than in the following Parable given us out of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. <q>
                        <hi>Lucifer</hi> having ſent forth his Officers to fill the World with Death and Ruine, they all went on their ſeveral Errands: Upon their Return he demands an account of their Proceedings, What Miſchiefs they had done, what Plagues they had ſcatter'd, and what Calamities they had ſent amongſt affrighted Mortals. One of them more forward than the reſt, Replies, He had been a Fortnight wandring about, and at laſt had Over-turn'd ſome Merchant-Ships at Sea, inſomuch that both Men and Goods were loſt. The Prince of Darkneſs enrag'd at his Lazineſs, inſtead of a Reward, gave him an Hundred Stripes, becauſe he had done no more Hurt all that time. Another Spirit ſtands forth, and Boaſts, that he had been for a Month together Contriving how to ſet ſuch a City on Fire, and had at laſt Effected it; and he alſo was ſeverely Puniſht for his Idleneſs, and neglect of Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Deſign ſooner. At laſt comes forth a Third, that had been Fourty Years abſent, and being ask'd how he had Promoted the Intereſt of the Black-Empire, anſwer'd, Thoſe Fourty Years have I been Tempting ſuch a Religious Man to Fornication, and have at laſt prevail'd, and at this time he wallows ſecurely in his Sin. <hi>Beelzebub</hi> immediately riſes from his Throne, hugs the miſchievous Fiend, Embraces the Child of Darkneſs, and with Rhetorick fetcht from Hell, Commends him before all the howling Crew, as having done a greater Exploit, after Fourty Years Travel, than the other did by Afflicting and Conſuming ſo many Men, Ships, and Houſes in a few Days and Weeks.</q> The Moral and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Fable is no other than this: That if he can make a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:151517:138"/> Believer, weary of his Heavenly Mindedneſs, and burning Zeal to God's Glory, he values that Piece of Miſchief more than if he Tempted a great many of thoſe, who are already Wicked, to greater Impieties. And that not only, becauſe of the Pride and Glory he takes in Conquering ſuch a <hi>Heroe</hi> in Chriſtianity, but becauſe to make One, who by his Exemplary Piety and Vertue, was an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Inſtrument in the Advancement of God's Glory, to become, by his Revolt from God, as great an Engine in promoting the Kingdom of Darkneſs, is to his Credit and Intereſt both.</p>
                  <p>And this conſider'd, the more Exemplarily Pious therefore any Man is, the more it concerns him, to beware of the Devil,<note place="margin">The more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarily Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous therefore any Man is, the more it concerns him to beware of the Devil, and all his Temptations.</note> and not to think himſelf ſecure on this ſide Heaven, from Satan's Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but <hi>He that thinketh he ſtandeth, ſhould take heed leſt he fall,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. And therefore I ſhall beſpeak ſuch in the words of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 Epiſt. 3.17, 18. <hi>Ye therefore Beloved, ſeeing ye know theſe things before, beware leſt ye alſo being led away with the Error of the Wicked, fall from your own ſtedfaſtneſs, but grow in Grace, and in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a word, and to ſumm up in ſhort what has been ſpoke on this Point; I have at length ſhew'd you, that next to the Deſtroying and Perverting of whole Churches, the Devil's great Induſtry is to gain over to his Party; or to Tempt to the Commiſſion of ſome grievous Sin, ſuch Perſons as are more than ordinarily Eminent for their <hi>Rank,</hi> or <hi>Quality,</hi> their <hi>Order,</hi> or their <hi>Piety,</hi> in the Church of God. And this being ſo; ſince ſuch are the great Mark of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, it concerns thoſe excellent Perſons, who are eminently Great, or Good, that they do eſpecially, and above all other Men <hi>abſolutely,</hi> and <hi>entirely,</hi> and <hi>utterly Renounce,</hi> and reſiſt all and every the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Satan, ſo as not to yield to any of 'em. Such are to look upon themſelves as the <hi>great Commanders in the Church Militant,</hi> who are to lead, and to go before others in the Battles of the Lord, againſt Sin and Satan; but if any ſuch ſhould Cowardly <hi>Give back in the day of Battle</hi> and Temptation, they <hi>put a ſtumbling Block, and are an occaſion to fall in their Brother's way,</hi> Rom. 14.13. And what ſays our Saviour in ſuch a Caſe? <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.6, 7. <hi>Whoſo ſhall offend One of thoſe little Ones, which Believe in him,</hi> that is, diſcourage and drive from the Chriſtian Practice, by his ſcandalous Life, any the meaneſt of his Diſciples, <hi>It were better for him, that a Mill-ſtone were hanged about his Neck, and he were drowned in the Depth of the Sea. Woe unto the World becauſe of Offences;</hi> he adds, <hi>It muſt needs be that Offences come, but Woe to that Man by whom the Offence cometh.</hi> So much it concerns Perſons Eminent in any Kind, that they be Good, as well as Great.</p>

                     <hi>THE Thirteenth Lecture.</hi> Firſt, That I ſhould Renounce the Devil, and all his Works; the Pomps and Vanity of this wicked World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh.</head>
                  <p>HAVING ſhew'd you, <hi>Who the Devil is,</hi> and <hi>What are his Works of Sin,</hi> and how we muſt <hi>Abſolutely Renounce</hi> both him and them. And as to that other great Work of his, <hi>his Tempting of us to Sin;</hi> having ſhewed you, Firſt, By what Methods he over-threw the whole Race of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind at firſt; and Secondly, How he does ſtill endeavour the Ruine of the Church of Chriſt; and eſpecially Thirdly, Of thoſe who are moſt conſiderable for their <hi>Rank,</hi> or <hi>Order,</hi> or <hi>Piety</hi> therein.</p>
                  <p>I am now Laſtly,<note place="margin">Laſtly, what Temptations Satan levels againſt all Perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently conſider'd.</note> in order to a more full Diſplay of that great Work of the Devil, his Tempting us to Sin, to diſcover to you ſome of the more remarkable Temptations at leaſt-wiſe, whereby he applies himſelf to all Perſons indifferently conſider'd, in the Church of Chriſt, be they High, or Low, to draw them into Sin.</p>
                  <p>In the former Attempts upon all Mankind, upon the Church of God, and upon thoſe conſiderable and leading Perſons therein, whoſe Fall ſweeps Multitudes along with 'em into Sin and Ruine; Satan ſhew'd more of his Ambition and Pride, as in ſetting up for a Dominion in direct Oppoſition to God's: So in waging a War with the greateſt Bodies of Men, and the moſt conſiderable Leaders in the <hi>Church Militant.</hi> But in theſe his latter Attempts upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons, whereby that Spirit appears not content to Foil greater Numbers, but moreover purſues his Victory to the picking up here and there every particular Stragler; he expreſſes more of his inveterate Malice, in that he is ſo wholly bent upon Miſchief and Deſtruction, as to ſtick at no Pains, and to leave no Methods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try'd, whereby he may deſtroy every particular Soul amongſt the the Sons of Men.</p>
                  <p>And indeed the Devil's Temptations are the more dangerous,<note place="margin">The Devil's Temptations not eaſily known to be his, nor always diſtinguiſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from thoſe of the World, and the Fleſh, which are manag'd and directed by him.</note> in that they are not eaſily known when they are his, and cannot always be diſtinguiſht from ſuch as the World, and our own Fleſh do give us; for which Reaſon, at the motion of theſe two latter, we do thoſe things without Fear, which if we knew the Devil had a Hand in, we ſhould tremble at the Thoughts of Committing. And indeed it is but ſeldom, the <hi>Devil</hi> does immediately, by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, actuate any One to do Evil; but generally he makes uſe of the <hi>World,</hi> and our own <hi>Fleſh,</hi> as his immediate Inſtruments, to move
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:151517:139"/> us to it: Whilſt he himſelf ſtands behind the Curtain, managing and directing thoſe, our other Enemies, to take their Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages againſt us. However, ſo far as the Scripture does diſcover to us any Methods of Temptations to be his,<note place="margin">Some of the moſt conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of his Methods of Tempting us diſcover'd.</note> we may ſafely aſcribe 'em unto him. And ſome of the more conſiderable and dangerous of 'em, I will lay before you.</p>
                  <p>As Firſt, <hi>The Devil does miſerably delude People into his Power, by letting 'em alone to be Obedient to God in ſome Particulars, the better to detain 'em perfect Slaves to himſelf in others.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> He permits, if not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſome in a partial O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God in ſome Particulars, the better to detain them perfect Slaves to himſelf in others.</note> This is call'd a <hi>Dividing between God and Mammon,</hi> Matth. 6.24. And indeed amongſt the manifold Deluſions of Satan, there is not a more fatal and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous One to the Souls of Men, than the Hypocriſy of a <hi>partial</hi> and Un-uniform Obedience, which the Devil does willingly enough allow us in. I ſay, <hi>The Devil does willingly enough allow Perſons to be partially, or in part Obedient;</hi> for when this cunning Deceiver can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prevail on ſome to be meer Libertines, to throw off all the Bonds and Ties of Religion; to be as Outragious in Profaneneſs, Impieties, Villanies, Whoredoms, and all ſorts of Wickedneſſes, as ſome of his Black Diſciples are; he is then willing to Compound the matter with ſuch, and ſo that they will be his a little, he'll contentedly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low 'em to be God's very much: Knowing very well, that if we hold out one diſloyal Fort againſt God, retain but one Rebel-Luſt, and give not up the whole Man unto Chriſt, it will as certainly Condemn us, tho' not to ſo great Degrees of Puniſhment, as if we were wholly Devoted to Satan, and gave our ſelves up to follow all our Brutiſh Luſts; the Word of God aſſuring us, that <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one Point, he is guilty of all,</hi> Jam. 2.10. And our Saviour declaring to us, that he will not be ſerv'd by Halves, nor endure the Devil to ſhare with him in his Kingdom over us; <hi>Ye cannot ſerve God and Mammon,</hi> Luk. 16.13. Thus the Devil knows it is his Intereſt to allow Men to be <hi>partially</hi> Obedient to God.</p>
                  <p>And, <hi>There is not a more fatal and miſchievous Deluſion of Satan than this is; eſpecially, when the partially Obedient exchanges ſome Sins of a ſcandalous Name, for their contrary Vertues, but lives notwithſtanding in other Impieties of a higher Nature.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">This a moſt fatal Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when ſome Sins on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Name, are exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Vertues, but with the Retention of Impieties of a higher Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> I ſay, when he changes ſome particular Sins only of a ſcandalous Name, as his former Debaucht and Lewd Courſe of Life, for a quite contrary One of Temperance and Chaſtity. He now aſſures himſelf, it was by the motion of God's Holy Spirit he is become a New Man, as he thinks, and that he is now infallibly ſafe. Thus have I often known thoſe of the Sect of <hi>Quakers,</hi> who have formerly been looſe and riotous Livers, Triumph very much in their preſent State, as certainly from God; becauſe they no ſooner became of this way, but they ceas'd to be Drunkards, and Swearers, and lewd Companions, and the like: Whereas, alas! The deluded Wretch has but Exchang'd ſome groſs Sins of a more <hi>ſcandalous Name,</hi> for other Impieties of a <hi>higher Nature.</hi> For now inſtead of the former more Carnal Sins, he has receiv'd into his Heart the more Spiritual and Deviliſh Ones, of Pride and Haughtineſs, and Contempt of others; being ſo far from <hi>In Honour preferring other Men,</hi> that he will not give the leaſt <hi>Honour to whom Honour is due.</hi> He now decries the inſpir'd Writings of God, as a
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:151517:139"/> 
                     <hi>dead Letter,</hi> and Blaſphemouſly entitles every fooliſh and deceitful Imagination of his own corrupt Heart, to the motion of the Holy Spirit; preferring the latter infinitely before the former. Nay, he now denies all the great Principles of Chriſtianity; the Divinity, Sufferings, and Satisfaction of Chriſt, with the Reſurrection of the Body, as moſt of our preſent Quakers do, and ſo is turn'd meer Deiſt at the beſt. And now who that conſiders this, can think otherwiſe, but that the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean Spirit went out of that Man, only to return into the houſe from whence he went out, and to take with himſelf ſeven other Spirits more wicked than himſelf, that they entering in, and dwelling there, the laſt State of that man might be worſe than the firſt? Matth.</hi> 12.43, 44, 45. This is certain,<note place="margin">Such the moſt Irreclaima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> the moſt Irreclaimable of all Sinners are thoſe, who have exchang'd ſome ill Practices, for others equally Wicked, and for impious Principles; for ſuch do fix themſelves in a full Perſwaſion, That their preſent Way is of God, ſeeing it is contrary to the former, which was undoubtedly the way of Satan: Whereas in Truth, both their former ill Practices, and their preſent evil Temper and Principles, are the Children of the ſame Father, tho' unlike to one another in outward Features. So fatal a Deluſion it is of the Devil's, to allow Sinners in performing a kind of <hi>Partial Obedience</hi> to God; nay to further 'em perhaps in the throwing off ſome ſenſual and groſly ſcandalous Courſes, that he may more ſecurely detain 'em Servants and Slaves to himſelf, in the leſs diſcernible ſins of ſpiritual Wickedneſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Another uſual Policy of the Devil's, in corrupting of our Manners, is to <hi>Put plauſible Names upon the worſt Sins, and under that diſguiſe to cheat Perſons into a good Opinion of 'em, and then to commit 'em.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> By put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting plauſible Names upon the worſt of Sins, under that diſguiſe he does cheat Perſons into a good Opinion of 'em, and then to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit 'em.</note> And he had the Impudence to Tempt even our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelf in this manner. He would have had him to throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf headlong from the Pinnacle of the Temple, alledging that <hi>God would give his Angels charge concerning him, and in their hands they ſhould bear him up,</hi> Matth. 4.6. And this no doubt he would have him believe, was a <hi>Truſting in God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in like manner, by a Satanical Device, the Preſumption of ſome, that they are the Elect, is call'd their Faith, by which they ſhall be Juſtified. Rioting and Drunkenneſs is call'd good Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to be eaſily withdrawn into it, the Effects of good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Covetouſneſs, Griping and Extortion, is term'd a providing for One's own, which he that does not do, is worſe than an Infidel. And on the contrary, to be Prodigal and Profuſe, is to be Hoſpitable and Charitable. Spite, Malice, and Revenge is call'd a Hating of other Men's Sins: And the moſt bitter and fierce Contentions, nay the moſt cruel and bloody Perſecutions, a Zeal for God, and true Religion; and when that Temper is juſtly expos'd to Hatred and Abhorrence, then a Lukewarmneſs, and a meer Indifferency in matters of Religion, whether Truth, or Hereſy prevails; <hi>Gallio</hi>'s <hi>caring for none of thoſe things,</hi> is ſtyl'd the calm and ſweet Temper and Spirit of the Goſpel. Thus does Sin paſs in the World currantly under the mask of Vertue. Vice appearing in its own Colours is ſo odious a thing, that no one but muſt be aſhamed to own it:<note place="margin">Sin in that diſguiſe gets Reputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men.</note> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing adorn'd by the Cunning of Satan with Titles of Reſpect, and in the ſhews of Vertue, it is lookt upon with no evil Eye; but gets Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:151517:140"/> and Reputation amongſt Men. But the Devil gets a Paſsport for ſeveral Sins into the World, not only by giving 'em the Name of Vertues: But,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>By changing the Nature of ſeveral Divine Graces and Vertues, ſo that they degenerate into very great Sins.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>III.</hi> By changing the Nature of ſeveral Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Graces, ſo that they degeneratein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to very great Sins.</note> It being much the Devil's Policy to Tranſport Perſons out of that Moderation wherein Vertue does for the moſt Part conſiſt, into that Exceſs which much reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles it, but is really exceedingly ſinful and hurtful to Men's Souls. This we gather to be the Devil's Policy from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. where the Apoſtle adviſes the <hi>Corinthians to Forgive,</hi> at the laſt, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous Perſon amongſt 'em, whom they had deſervedly Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, and to receive him to the Communion of the Church, being he had Humbled himſelf, and Repented; and that Mercy he would have 'em ſhew him, leſt Satan ſhould get an Advantage over 'em: <hi>For we are not ignorant of his Devices,</hi> ſays he, that is, leſt the too long continuance of the Puniſhments they inflicted upon the Penitent Offender, might be made uſe of by Satan to the hurt and ruine of the Church, by hightning their Zeal againſt Sin into an Irreconcilableneſs to the Sinner. And indeed there are many Sins and Vertues ſo near in their Nature, that the Paſſage from one to the other is hardly diſcernible; inſomuch, that by the Art of Satan, we eaſily ſlide from one to the other: As Obſtinacy in ſtanding out againſt all Conviction concerning the Truth, is eaſily miſtaken for Conſtancy in the Faith, and the Love of Our-ſelves, for the Love of God. But eſpecially, that Zeal for God's Glory, now mention'd, a moſt Excellent Grace in it ſelf, is often, and that eaſily Tranſported into Cruelty, as we ſee it was in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who out of a Zeal for the Law, <hi>Beyond meaſure perſecuted the Church of God, and waſted it,</hi> Gal. 1.13. Thus by changing the Nature of ſeveral Divine Graces and Vertues, ſo that they become very great ſins, does Satan eaſily betray us into them.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is a moſt deſtructive Policy of Satan, <hi>To put New Beginners in the Spiritual Life, upon greater Severities and Strictneſſes in Religion, than they are capable of, on purpoſe, that when they gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Which Inability, or Weakneſs, I ſay, to go through any <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> and <hi>undertaken</hi> Piece of Diſcipline, as of long Faſtings, and Watchings at ſuch ſet Hours of the Night, or the Performance of certain Vows, which ſome do lay upon themſelves; theſe, tho' they may be ſerviceable to promote a ſpiritual Life, if diſcreetly and adviſedly undertaken by a Perſon, and with a juſt Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had to his own Ability and Circumſtances: yet they are greater Severities than what many can go through with, and when impos'd upon themſelves by ſuch, they give occaſion to Satan to Tempt 'em to throw off thoſe voluntary Services, together with all Religion, as not Performable by Fleſh and Blood, or by any thing ſhort of Angels. Whereas indeed, it is not the Subſtantials of Religion, ſuch as our Saviour preſcrib'd, whoſe <hi>Yoke is eaſy, and whoſe Burden is light,</hi> Matth. 11.30. that are ſo; but thoſe Acceſſories and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages to it, which ſome do indiſcreetly, and without regard to their own Capacities and Circumſtances, lay upon themſelves.</p>
                  <p>And here it may be uſeful to let you know,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between God's Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Devil's Management of Men in theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> what a Great Maſter in the ſpiritual Life obſerves,<note place="margin">Bona de Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretione Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, <hi>Cap.</hi> 6.</note> concerning the difference between God's Ordering, and the Devil's Management of Men in theſe matters. <q>God begins with us at low Degrees, and gently leads us from an imperfect, to a perfect State. He has regard to Perſons and their Age, and imparts one degree of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the Aged, another to Youth, one to Beginners, another to the Perfect. But the Devil, on the contrary, obſerves no Order, but darts into our Souls unſeaſonable Heats, and forthwith ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts Exceſſes in Devotion. He perſwades ſuch immediately to undertake immoderate Faſtings and Watchings, and to mortify the Body by intolerable Penances.</q> And theſe Burdens, becauſe they lay upon themſelves without meaſure, they are not able to bear; and then their Strength being broke, and the Vigour of their Minds abated, they do at length backſlide into meer Indifferency and Looſeneſs.

                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Satan by Injecting of evil Thoughts into our Minds, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and diſturb our Devotions, is very Induſtrious to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhallow and Spoil thoſe Services, whereby we ſhall moſt really, and immediately, and directly Honour and Glorify our Maker, and Benefit our own Souls.</hi>

And being Divine Worſhip is the chief of all our Services we pay to our Maker, as being that, wherein we do moſt immediately and directly of all others, Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy God, and derive down Bleſſings upon our own Souls, if rightly perform'd; the Devil is therefore too too buiſy about us, when we are at our Devotions, to unhallow and ſpoil 'em. Thus we read, <hi>Job</hi> 1.6. that <hi>when the Sons of God came to preſent themſelves before the Lord, Satan came alſo amongſt them.</hi> And ſo likewiſe <hi>Zechar.</hi> 3.1. we find, that <hi>when</hi> Joſhua <hi>the High-Prieſt ſtood before the Angel of the

This ſure cannot happen, but by the importunate Urgency of ſome malicious Spirit, who is marvellouſly Induſtrious to let, and hinder us in nothing more, than in this moſt Glorious and Beneficial Service, of our Prayers and Praiſes to Almighty God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">And thus he hinders the Efficacy of the Word.</note>And hence alſo in the <hi>Hearing of the Word,</hi> does he either bring a Drowſineſs upon the Hearers, ſo that even at the very inſtant, we the Ambaſſadors of Chriſt are Proclaiming to ſinful Men, thoſe gracious Terms of Reconciliation ſent to them by us, from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Majeſty of Heaven: They will even ſleep all the time of its Delivery, or he will endeavour to poſſeſs their Minds with ſuch vain, wandring and worldly Thoughts, that the Seed ſown, for want of their Attention, can never take Root in their Hearts. And this not attending to, and not conſidering what you are about, and what you hear, is expreſly affirm'd to be from Satan, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.19. <hi>When any One heareth the Word, and underſtandeth it not,</hi> that is, lays it not to Heart, thinks not of it, nor conſiders it; for ſo the Word Tranſlated <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>The Devil obſerves the outward Wants and Neceſſities of Perſons, and accordingly Tempts 'em to the uſe of unlawful and undue Means to remove thoſe Evils.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>VI.</hi> The Devil obſerving the outward Wants and Neceſſities of Perſons, he accordingly Tempts them by the uſe of unlawful Means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</note> Thus he dealt with our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.2, 3. <hi>And when he had Faſted Fourty Days, and Fourty Nights, and afterwards was an hungred, then the Tempter came to him and ſaid, If Thou be the Son of God, command that theſe Stones be made Bread;</hi> that is, he would have him, out of an Impatience of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ordinary Means of ſatisfying his Hunger, to Tempt God to Feed him Super-naturally, and by way of Miracle. And if a Man be Sick, and want preſent Help in lawful Means, then will the Devil Tempt ſuch a One, to ſeek his Remedy by Charms and Spells, as a more ſhort, certain, and eaſy way of Curing, than by Phyſical Medicines; and no doubt the Devil may ſometims work extraordinary Feats by theſe methods, the better to keep Mankind in Dependance upon himſelf: But it is a certain ſign of want of Grace, and of none, no not the leaſt Fear of God in them, who ſhall reſort, in ſuch Caſes, to Perſons ſuſpected to hold Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the Devil, and ſhall make uſe of thoſe means of Cure preſcrib'd by 'em, concerning whoſe Operation of any ſuch Cure, no Reaſon in Nature can be given, nor the Appointment of God pretended, that ſuch Words, tho' they may be Words of Scripture, ſhould work ſuch Effects.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>The Devil knowing every particular Perſons inward Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Diſpoſition, both of Body and Mind, better many times, than he himſelf does; he accordingly preſents ſuch Objects to the Fancy, as ſhall be likelieſt to prevail over ſuch a Man to commit ſome grievous Sin.</hi>

                        <hi>VII.</hi> Knowing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſon's inward Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, he accordingly preſents ſuch Objects to the Fancy, as ſhall be likelieſt to prevail over ſuch a Man to commit ſome grievous Sin.</note> Thus is a Perſon of a melancholly Diſpoſition, to ſuch a One he either aggravates the matter of his Diſcontent, or he will preſent to the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:151517:141"/> Fancy ſo many frightful Objects, and will load his Mind with ſuch a multitude of black and diſmal Apprehenſions; that the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly Wretch ſhall be weary of himſelf, and will ſly from that worſt of Tormentors, he thinks, his own Mind, even to the Grave, and into Deſtruction it ſelf for Refuge. And hence it is, that ſo many miſerable Wretches hang, ſtab, drown, or ſhoot themſelves, being thus Tempted thereto by Satan. And hence it is, that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of a melancholly Temper of Mind are ſo apt, above others, to be troubled with Blaſphemous Thoughts, tho' Perſons of great Piety, and ſuch as have all along <hi>Feared God, and kept his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Both theſe, and the former Apprehenſions are ſome of thoſe <hi>Fiery Darts of the Devil,</hi> mention'd <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.16. caſt into the Soul, at ſuch time, when they are leaſt able to Repel 'em; and that on purpoſe to diſturb the poor melancholly Wretch to the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, ſo as to do Violence to his own Nature, and to deſtroy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; or to force from him Expreſſions moſt highly Diſhonou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>able to God, and Terrible to Chriſtian Ears to hear. But,</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, The great Battery of the Devil, whereby he does ſtorm the Innocency, and ſhake the Conſtancy of the greateſt Part of Mankind, <hi>Is his Repreſenting to the Fancy of Men, the Conveniency of Riches, the Glory of Honours, and the Sweetneſs of Pleaſures, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to Bribe 'em to Rebel againſt God, and to Sin againſt their own Souls.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>VIII.</hi> Above all by Repreſenting to the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Men, the Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and the Sweetneſs of Pleaſures, he does there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Bribe 'em to Rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and to Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their own Souls.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>This I call his great Battery, and uſually therefore he does Aſſault us therewith, not till all others have fail'd him. In this manner he dealt with our Saviour. When all his other Temptations prov'd ineffectual, <hi>The Devil taketh him up into an exceeding high Mountain, and ſheweth him all the Kingdoms of the World, and the Glory of 'em. And ſaith unto him, All theſe things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me,</hi> Matth. 4.8, 9. But altho' the Son of God was no more to be won upon by this, than by any of the former, to comply in the leaſt with the Deſigns of the wicked Tempter: Yet the Weakneſs of the Generality of Men is ſuch, that they are Brib'd hereby, when nothing elſe can prevail, to Apoſtatize from God, to do Injuries to Men, and to do the greateſt Abuſes to their own Reaſon and Nature; and in ſhort, to commit every Kind of Sin, whereby God is Diſhonour'd, and they themſelves ſhall be finally Ruin'd.</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Manner</hi> and Cunning wherewith the Devil manages theſe Temptations, is extreamly well worth your Notice. When he makes any Repreſentation to our Souls of this World's Glory, he only ſhews us the faireſt Out-ſide of thoſe Things, to allure us thereby into Sin, induſtriouſly concealing all that is vain, and vexatious, and ſtinging therein, which would deter us from it.<note place="margin">In his Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of this World's Goods, he ſhews only the fair out-ſide to allure into Sin, induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that is hurtful therein, and would deter Men from it.</note> Thus he manag'd the matter with our Saviour, and thus he does ſtill with us. In that World, and the Glory thereof, which he ſhew'd to our Bleſſed Lord, there was a great mixture of Confuſion, and Diſorder, and Croſſes, and Vexations, and Troubles; but nothing of this did he repreſent to his View, when he offer'd it to him as a Bribe; but only gave him to ſee the Plenty, the Grandeur, the Beauty thereof, ſeparated from the other ungrateful and diſpleaſing Part: And ſo he deals with us. He does very lively preſent to Men the Advantage of Riches, how that Money commands all Things, and then ſtirs up their Covetous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:151517:142"/> after it, ſo as to get it they care not how, by Thieving, and Robbery, by Cozennage, and Extortion, and Sacriledge, or by any unlawful Arts and Methods. He does dazle their Eyes with the Splendor and Glory of High Places, lets 'em ſee the Cap, and the Knee, and low Obeiſances, and the ſervile Flatteries made to the Grandees of this World, to ſtir up their Ambition to wade through Seas of Blood, and to tread upon the Necks of oppreſſed Provinces, in order to mount thoſe Seats of Honour. And laſtly, he does very lively lay before their Eyes the Luxury and Wantonneſs, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eaſe found in ſenſual Pleaſures, and ſo inflames their Luſts and Appetites after the Enjoyment of 'em: But he draws a dark ſhade over the deformed Part of the World, that we may not perceive thoſe manifold Troubles, and Vexations, and Diſappointments, and Puniſhments, attending theſe Things in the unlawful getting of 'em; and the never-failing Remorſes and Regrets of Conſcience, Amazing, and Diſtracting, and ſtinging, with a Venom more inflam'd and furious than that of Scorpions, the Souls who wickedly purſue and attain to thoſe Things. All this dark Part he reſerves till this World's Goods are ſo unjuſtly got, to work upon their Shame and Deſpair, in order to promote his farther Deſigns upon 'em, as you will ſee in his following Temptations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As,</hi> Ninthly, <hi>When any have been once prevail'd upon by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency, the Beauty, the Honour, or the Pleaſure of any of theſe Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, which the Devil has preſented to their Fancies, to commit Sin to obtain them: Then he fails not to lay the Shame and Diſgrace of their Sins before them, and will perſwade them to commit another horrid Wickedneſs, to hide from the Eyes of Men the Shame of the former.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>IX.</hi> Having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by upon Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſome gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Sin to obtain them, he then lays the ſhame and Diſgrace of their Sins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'em, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading 'em to commit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother horrid Wickedneſs, to hide from the Eyes of Men the ſhame of the former.</note> Thus when he had Tempted <hi>David</hi> to commit Adultery with <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> the Wife of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> then muſt the Injur'd Husband be made Drunk, that his Lying with his Wife might not be Diſcover'd, when he return'd from the Battle; but that he and the World might think the Child Begotten was his own: And when that would not make <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> go in unto his Wife, then at laſt he muſt be Murder'd, by being put into the Front of the Battle, and then Treacherouſly left to be Cut off by the Enemy, that ſhe being freed of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Husband, he might without Scandal to the Eye of the world, Enjoy her as his own Wife. And how often do we ſee the like Device to draw Men into Sin, acted over and over at this Day, and many lewd, ungodly Perſons, after they have committed Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, privately to murder their own Off-ſpring, to prevent the Shame and Diſgrace that will follow, the Fact being known. And when Children and Servants have done amiſs, how commonly are they prompted to tell a Lye, nay, and ſometimes to Swear to it, that it may not be diſcover'd? The Devil well knows that Sin is like laying a Train of Gun-Powder, which if you fire but One Corn, it will preſently give Flame to all the reſt: So one Sin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the ſhame of that will engage you to commit another to hide the former. And therefore it is, I ſay, the uſual Policy of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, when he has Tempted any Perſon to commit a Wickedneſs, then to lay the Shame and Diſgrace thereof ſo ſenſibly before him, that he ſhall again commit a worſe, on purpoſe to cover the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the former from the Eyes of Men.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And then,</hi> Tenthly, <hi>When he has once Engag'd a Perſon into many Sins, either he will lull him into a fatal Security,</hi>

                        <hi>X.</hi> Having once Engaged a Perſon into many Sins, he either lulls him in ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or drives him into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.</note> 
                     <hi>whereby he fooliſhly perſwades himſelf, that God will deal more mercifully with him, than he has declared in his Word; or elſe Satan will not fail to preſent at laſt to ſuch an enormous Sinner's Conſcience, the infinite Guilt and Horrour of his Crimes, to make him deſpair if he can, that ever they will be Forgiven, they are ſo many and Monſtrous: That ſo he may never endeavour to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, or ſo much as fly to God in Prayer, to have Mercy on him.</hi> At firſt he preſented to the Sinner's Fancy nothing but the Beauty, the Conveniency, the Pleaſure, the Glory of the Things of this World; as of the Pleaſures, Riches, and the Honours of this Life, with all their Advantages, without any thing of that Sting, and Remorſe, and Trouble, that muſt neceſſarily attend them, if unlawfully pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued and obtain'd. But when by this Means the Sinner has run on, without the leaſt ſtop or ſtay, into a vaſt Number of <hi>waſting Sins,</hi> (ſome of them perhaps of ſuch a Nature, that no Reparation or Reſtitution can be made for them, as Adultery and Murder,) Then will he pour in all of a ſudden, whole Broad-ſides, ſuch an Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and ſuch an amazing ſence of Guilt, into the Soul of ſuch a Sinner, that thinking it to no purpoſe to Retreat, he ſhall puſh on to commit the moſt outragious Villanies, till at length when Death ſeizes him, he goes down into Hell, deſperately <hi>Curſing the Day he was Born,</hi> and Blaſpheming that God, who gave him a Being.</p>
                  <p>And now Laſtly, I ſhall not mention any other way, wherein Satan tempts Men, except it be when <hi>God in Puniſhment to ſome ſort of Sinners, does abandon them to the Devil,</hi>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:151517:143"/> damning Sins that lay waſt the Conſcience, have baffled all the Methods of his Grace to reclaim them, and have reſiſted and grieved his Holy Spirit ſo long, till Grace be wholly withdrawn from them:</hi> Such are called <hi>Children of Diſobedience,</hi> Eph. 2.2. which in the Phraſe of Scripture does ſignify Perſons extreamly Diſobedient; and of ſuch it is ſaid in the ſame Verſe, that the <hi>Evil Spirit worketh in them.</hi> He does act them as the Soul does the Body, and does hurry them into ſuch vicious Extravagancies, and to commit ſuch outragious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties, that they ſeem to be Devils Incarnate. Thus did the Devil enter into <hi>Judas,</hi> Luk. 22.3. after he had formerly Baffled all the good Admonitions of our Saviour, to reclaim him from his Thievery, and other Villanies, and at length ſpur'd him on to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Blackeſt Crime, that ever was heard of, even to Betray the Lord of Life into the Hands of his Enemies. And there are many ungodly Wretches now a-days, who do ſeem to ſin with ſo much Enmity and Deſpite againſt God, that it is hard to ſay, whether they are not Devils in Humane Shapes. But it is the ſame thing; they have ſinn'd themſelves to that Degree, that God has given them up, and the Devil ſeems to Animate them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">And laſtly ſo are Witches, Magicians, and Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, who have Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted away both Body &amp; Soul to the Devil, on Condition he will be for ſome time at their Beck, to execute their vile and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</note>A Third ſort of Perſons abandon'd by God (and that utterly) to the Power and Management of Satan, to actuate them as he pleaſes, <hi>Are Witches, and Magicians, or Conjurers,</hi> ſuch as was that Woman of whom we read, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. And theſe are a ſort of miſerable Wretches, ſo far forſaken of Grace, and the Fear of God, that they have expreſly <hi>Covenanted</hi> away both Body and Soul to the Devil, on Condition he will be at their Beck to Execute their vile and malicious Purpoſes. For Envy, Malice, and Revenge ſeems to be the Soul, that animates theſe <hi>Children of the Devil;</hi> or elſe the Pride and Vanity of doing Wonders, and an inſatiable Curioſity of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe ſecret Things to come, which belong to God alone to know, has put 'em upon making ſuch a <hi>Contract</hi> with Satan. And theſe wretched Miſcreants ſure muſt be ſuppos'd to be utterly ſhut out from the leaſt Glimpſe of God's Favour, and caſt out of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and to be wholly under the Power of the Devil. The thing is ſelf-evident, ſo as not to need any Pains to make it appear. And in all Probability, they have alſo their Eternal Damnation ſeal'd in this World, <hi>Even before they go hence, and be no more ſeen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus I have at length ſhew'd you, as before, <hi>Who the Devil is, and what are his Works of Sin, and how you are to Renounce both him and them:</hi> So I have now laid open before you, as fully as I could (not indulging meer Conjecture, but fetching my Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries from the Holy Scripture, from which alone we can learn any thing of Certainty in ſuch a dark Subject;) I ſay, I have fully laid before you thoſe manifold Methods of Temptation, whereby he did, and does ſtill Attempt, Firſt, The whole Race of Mankind; Secondly, The Church of Chriſt; Thirdly, The moſt Conſiderable and Leading Perſons therein; and Laſtly, Every ſingle and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Perſon indifferently amongſt us.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral View of the Works of the Devil, both of Sin and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it does appear, his Drift is no leſs than to uſurp God's Throne, and to draw the whole Race of Mankind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame Curſed Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt the Majeſty of Heaven, with himſelf.</note>And upon the general View of what has been ſaid it does appear, that the whole Drift of that wicked Spirit, and of all his Works, both of Sin and Temptation, is no leſs than to Uſurp God's Throne, and to put up a Dominion in Oppoſition to his, and to draw the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:151517:143"/> whole Race of Mankind into the ſame Curſed Rebellion againſt the Majeſty of Heaven, owning him, the Devil, for their Lord and Maſter.</p>
                  <p>'Tis indeed a thing almoſt incredible, that a <hi>Creature</hi> could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be guilty of ſuch impudent Pride and Ambition, as to juſtle God, as it were, out of his Throne, and to Arrogate to himſelf the Homage of all the Creatures; but yet it appears to be plainly ſo, by his Tempting even of the Son of God himſelf to Worſhip and Adore him, and in his Plying him ſo diligently with one Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after another, never letting him reſt, till he ſaw there was no Hopes. He perceiv'd, that his Coming into the World was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his Kingdom, and therefore he firſt Attacks him in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, thinking he had him at an Advantage, after a long Faſt of Fourty Days, and that in his Hunger he would do any thing to get Bread. And when our Saviour alledg'd his ſufficiency in God alone, without material Bread, he then takes him up into the Holy City, and ſetteth him on the Pinnacle of the Temple; bidding him, if he were ſo confident of God's Protection and Preſervation of him, to caſt himſelf down from thence, and no doubt he would order his Holy Angels to receive him. And when in that alſo he was Repuls'd, Satan try'd him farther yet, and taking him into an exceeding high Mountain, where he gave him a <hi>Viſionary View</hi> of all the Riches, Glory and Splendor of the World, and proffer'd him, that if he would Fall down and Worſhip him; that is, Deſert the Service of the God of Heaven, and coming over to him, would Propagate and Promote his Kingdom, and do Homage himſelf, and cauſe all others to do the like to him: This, if he would do, Satan Promis'd him all theſe things would he give him. Thus like a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Prince, who would Bribe with Riches, and Honours, and Preferments, the General of another's Army, to come over to him, and to Betray into his Power all his own King's Subjects: So did the Devil Tempt our Saviour, <hi>the great Captain of our Salvation,</hi> to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt himſelf from God, and to bring over the whole Church along with him. So infinitely bent is Satan upon the Diſhonour of God, and our Slavery and Ruine; which as it is enough to rouze us up to make a moſt diligent Enquiry, till we fully diſcover all the Arts and Methods, whereby he would accompliſh it: So it will, I hope, ſufficiently Juſtify my having been ſo long in laying before you, <hi>Who the Devil is, and what are his Works,</hi> both of Sin and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, And now it remains only to ſhew you,<note place="margin">What it is, and how we muſt renounce this great Work of the Devil, his Tempting of us to Sin.</note> and then I ſhall have done this Point, <hi>What it is, and how we muſt Renounce this great Work of the Devil, his Tempting of us to Sin.</hi> The word <hi>Renounce,</hi> I before told you, is a Word that bears various ſignifications, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Nature of the Thing to be Renounced by us. And as the Devil being that Arch-Rebel againſt God, whoſe Quarrel with him is for no leſs, than Dominion and Empire over the World, who ſhall be King thereof, God, or Satan; and who, with all his Legions of Infernal Spirits are continually muſtering up all their Forces againſt the Authority of God, and drawing wretched ſinful Men into the Conſpiracy. As the Devil being ſuch, to <hi>Renounce the Devil,</hi> as I have told you, is to diſclaim, or leave off having any
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:151517:144"/> Hand with him in his baſe and ungrateful Rebellion againſt God. And as to his Works of Sin: As by Sin God's Laws are Tranſgreſt, his Authority thrown off, his Government diſown'd, and his Power defy'd: So to <hi>Renounce his works of Sin,</hi> muſt ſignify to diſclaim, or abandon every Sin, as a thing moſt diſhonourable and provoking to God, becauſe it implies a throwing off his Authority, and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning his Power. As this is to <hi>Renounce the Devil and all his works of Sin:</hi> So as to that other great Work of his, his Temptations of us, thoſe will properly be then only Renounc'd, when they are <hi>Reſiſted</hi> by us;<note place="margin">The Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Devil are then only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, when they are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by us.</note> a thing which we are Commanded to do, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Reſiſt the Devil;</hi> as alſo, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Whom Reſiſt ſtedfaſt in the Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how ſhall ſuch weak and impotent Creatures as we are, be able to Reſiſt ſuch a mighty Spirit, or rather ſuch a powerful Hoſt of Spirits, as the Devils are? For are there not Multitudes of 'em ſurrounding of us, as appears by one Man's having a whole Legion of 'em caſt out of him? And did not the great Fiend, the Ring-leader of 'em own to God, that it was his Employment to <hi>Go to and fro in the Earth, and to walk up and down in it,</hi> Job 1.7. to find out ſuch, whom with the greateſt Probability of Succeſs he may aſſault, and to ſee againſt what weak part of 'em, either in Body or Mind, he may moſt advantagiouſly raiſe his Batteries? Nay, and is it not ſaid, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 8.9. <hi>That as a roaring Lion, he continually walks about the Earth, ſeeking whom he may devour:</hi> So that beſides his Induſtry and Policy, he does with the greateſt Violence and Fury oftentimes ſet upon us?

                  <p>But notwithſtanding all the Multitude, the Policy, nor the Fury of Devils, we need not be Diſhearten'd; for as we are Commanded in the fore-cited Place of St. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.7. <hi>To Reſiſt him:</hi> So we have a Promiſe of being ſucceſsful when we do.<note place="margin">That they may be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted.</note>

Thus 1 Pet. 5.8, 9. <hi>Be Sober, becauſe your Adverſary, the Devil, as a Roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lion, walketh about ſeeking whom he may devour, whom Reſiſt ſtedfaſt in the Faith.</hi> And indeed Sobriety, as it is contrary both to Drunkenneſs, and Paſſion, is a great and moſt neceſſary Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive againſt Satan's Temptations.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> Sobriety. As oppoſite to Drunkenneſs, a neceſſary Preſervative againſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</note> 
                     <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> is a thing does ſo Overwhelm all the Powers of the Soul, that whilſt Perſon is in that Condition, he has little, ſometimes no uſe of his Memory, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Judgment, ſo as to have any Thoughts of Good and Evil, or to diſcern between what is Fit and Reaſonable, and what is Hurtful and Brutiſh. And only the Luſts and Appetites of a Man are then awake, ready to hurry him to whatſoever Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:151517:144"/> he ſhall be Tempted. And do you think, that the Devil, who is ſo Cunning in Timeing his Temptations, will then be Idle, and not ſtrike in with the Seaſon, and at ſuch an Opportunity preſent to the Wretch, when depriv'd of Reaſon and Grace, ſuch Baits as ſhall be likelieſt to take him? Why, this to be ſure he will; and hence we hear of ſo many Brutiſh Extravagancies, and ſinful Frolicks, ſo much Lewdneſs, Swearing, Robberies and Blood-ſhed, acted and committed in Drunkenneſs: ſuch great Reaſon there is, that as you would preſerve your ſelves from Sin; ſo likewiſe muſt you preſerve your ſelves ſober, and free from Drunkenneſs, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you will be Overtaken therewith.</p>
                  <p>

                        <hi>II.</hi> As oppoſite te Paſſion.</note> in which caſe Perſons are as much depriv'd of Reaſon, as in the other, and are hurry'd on to the like Commiſſions; and the Devil will be alike ready, both to influence the Paſſion, and to ſuggeſt Provocations, if Sobriety does not ſtrike in, and moderate. Hence is the Paſſionate and Violent Tongue, ſaid to be <hi>Set on fire of Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Watchfulneſs is another Means to Reſiſt Temptations.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> Watchful o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thoſe our weakneſſes, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially where Satan will be likelieſt to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt us.</note> Thus again, in order thereunto, in the ſame Place of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Ep. 5.8, 9. It is ſaid, <hi>Be Sober, be Vigilant.</hi> He is Vigilant for his Part to do you Miſchief, and watches all Advantages, to get you into his Power and Reach: And it lies upon you to be as careful to Guard your ſelves againſt all his Batteries, which he Plays againſt you. He ſurrounds the Soul, and views it on all ſides: <q>And this great Enemy of Mankind, ſays a Father, does there lay his Snares of Deceit, where there is the greateſt Probability they will take us. He knows to whom he may beſt apply the Heats of Luſt, before whom he may ſpread the Table of Gluttony, and to whoſe View he may diſplay the Enchantments of all ſorts of Luxury. He conſiders the Temper of Men's Minds, and whom he can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order with Grief, and whom he may deceive with Joy, whom he can oppreſs with Fear, and whom he may ſeduce with Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and into whoſe Breaſt he can moſt eaſily Infuſe the Poiſon of Envy. He examines the Cuſtoms of Men, he conſiders what are their Cares, and he ſearches which are our prevailing Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. And by that he takes occaſion to do us the greateſt hurt, to which he ſees we are moſt violently addicted, and about which he ſees us moſt induſtriouſly Employ'd. Like an Enemy, who Beſieges a City, does always aſſault the weakeſt part of the Walls: So does he attack the Soul, where he perceives its greateſt Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</q> Such infinite Reaſon have we to conſider our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to keep a particular Watch on that ſide, where we are moſt Blind, and to ſet our ſelves with the greateſt Vigour to Reſiſt and Repel the Temptations, wherewith he will aſſault us there. And this is the Second way given you in Scripture to Reſiſt Satan's Temptations, <hi>viz.</hi> Watchfulneſs and Diligence to know our ſelves, and to diſcern his Temptations, that ſo you may not be Enſnar'd by them. The</p>
                  <p>Third, <hi>Is by Prayer to God to protect you from them.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">And Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we muſt be conſtant and fervent in Prayer to God to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect us from them.</note> Thus <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.8. after we are commanded to <hi>Reſiſt the Devil, and he will Fly from us;</hi> as an effectual way ſo to do, we are bid to <hi>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to us;</hi> that is, if we will make our humble
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:151517:145"/> Addreſſes to God by Prayer, he will be ready to aſſiſt us againſt all his Temptations. And indeed there is extraordinary Reaſon, you ſhould diligently and earneſtly Pray to God, to Protect and Preſerve you from Satan's Deluſions. The Devil is a Spirit, and therefore is naturally Endow'd with a great deal of Knowledge, abundance more than we Men are capable of attaining to. And moreover, by the Experience of many Thouſand Years, from the Creation of the World, unto this Day, he has greatly Improv'd himſelf in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of miſchievous Cunning and Subtlety; ſo as not to be Ignorant of any way, whereby he may moſt ſucceſsfully prevail over us, to draw us into Sin. Both which things conſider'd, we were not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to Cope with him, if left to our ſelves. But our Comfort is this, That the Devil can go no farther than his Chain; and as the Divine Goodneſs will not permit him to attempt whom, and how he pleaſes: (It was not before he had Leave, that he could Tempt <hi>Job,</hi> 2.6.) ſo in reference to all ſorts of Temptations whatſoever, we have a moſt ſure word of Promiſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. that <hi>God is Faithful, who will not ſuffer you to be Tempted above that you are able, but will with the Temptation alſo make a way to eſcape, that you may be able to bear it.</hi> But then, if you would have him a Protector, always ready at Hand to aſſiſt you, you muſt, as was ſaid, <hi>Draw nigh to him, and he will draw nigh to you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What ſhall I ſay? Why, what farther Directions are neceſſary for <hi>Reſiſting of Satan's Temptations,</hi> together with an earneſt Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſo to do, are given you in thoſe moſt excellent Words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to the <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.10, 11, 12. with which I ſhall conclude. <hi>Finally Brethren be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the Power of his might; Put on the whole Armour of God, that ye may be able to ſtand againſt the Wiles of the Devil. For we wreſtle not againſt Fleſh and Blood, but againſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities, againſt Powers, againſt the Rulers of the darkneſs of this world, againſt ſpiritual wickedneſs in high Places: Wherefore take unto you the whole Armour of God, that ye may be able to ſtand in the Evil Day, and having done all to ſtand:</hi> And ſo goes on in ſeveral Verſes, ſhewing with what Armour you muſt prepare your ſelves, wherewith to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend your Innocency againſt the Aſſaults of Satan, <hi>viz.</hi> with <hi>Truth,</hi> or the Knowledge of the Goſpel, <hi>with Righteouſneſs, Charity, Faith, the Hope of Salvation, and the word of God:</hi> And then adds, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore directed you, <hi>That you muſt Pray always, with all Prayer and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all Perſeverance.</hi>

                  <p>HAVING already, in order to the Explication of theſe Words, ſhew'd you, <hi>Who the Devil is, what are his Works, what is meant by Renouncing the Devil, and all his Works, and how neceſſary it is we ſhould abſolutely do ſo;</hi> I come now,</p>

                     <note place="margin">What's meant by the Pomps and Vanity of the wicked World, and in what ſence, and how far we muſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the wicked world w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> its Pomps and Vanity.

                  <p>
                     <hi>To Renounce the Pomps and Vanity of this wicked World.</hi> There is not a word here but will require ſome Explication. As to the word <hi>Renounce</hi> indeed it may ſuffice, what I before told you, that it is of various Significations, according to the Nature of the Thing to be Renounc'd by us: And there being Three Things in theſe Words neceſſary to be Explain'd,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The World;</hi> Secondly, <hi>The wicked World;</hi> and Thirdly, <hi>The Pomps and Vanity of this wicked World;</hi> I will Expound to you the Meaning of each, and will withal ſhew you in what ſence, and how far you are to Renounce every One of them.</p>
                  <p>And Firſt, <hi>I am to ſhew you, what is meant by the World, and in what Sence, and how far you are to Renounce the World.</hi> The World in Scripture does generally paſs under a very bad Character, and for the moſt part is mention'd, as what does directly oppoſe God's Glory, and our own Happineſs.<note place="margin">The World a great Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to God's Glory, and our own Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</note> Thus Jam. 4.4. <hi>Know ye not that the Friendſhip of the World is Enmity with God, and whoſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will be a Friend of the World, is an Enemy of God.</hi> And on the contrary, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives this Character of himſelf, <hi>That through the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the World is Crucified unto him, and he unto the World.</hi> And, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4. it is univerſally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, that <hi>Whoſoever is born of God overcometh the World:</hi> And therefore in the Second Chapter of the ſame <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 15, 16. we are commanded, <hi>Not to love the World, neither the Things that are in the World,</hi> being aſſur'd, that <hi>If any man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> And indeed, if we ſhall ſearch through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Book of God, we ſhall find ſuch frequent and earneſt Commands to Renounce this World, and to beware of its Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,

                  <p>And a more nice and critical Enquiry and State of this Matter is the rather neceſſary, becauſe the World, as hardly as it is ſpoke of, is not abſolutely, and in its own Nature Evil, as the Devil is; for, conſider'd in it ſelf, it is the Creature of God, and conſequently very Good, according to that Divine Teſtimony given thereunto, Gen. 1.31. <hi>God ſaw every thing that he had made, and behold it was very Good:</hi> And it is only Evil accidentally by our Abuſe of it. That therefore you may Err on neither ſide, neither deſpiſe the Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God's Hands, to the Diſparagement of God's Goodneſs, in giving us of his Creatures for our Uſe and Convenience; nor too much Dote upon the <hi>Creature,</hi> to the Neglect of the <hi>Creator,</hi> which is a Degree of Idolatry: I will, with what Skill God ſhall enable me, ſtate this whole matter to you, and ſhew you, <hi>What is meant by the World, and in what Sence, and how far you are to Renounce it.</hi> And for the more full and compleat Explication of this Point, I will do it, both Generally and Particularly.<note place="margin">It is to be conſider'd both generally and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Firſt, as to the World in General, it is viſible what is meant by it, <hi>viz.</hi> The whole Frame of Nature, which we behold, with whatever is contain'd therein. True it is, the World is put many times in Scripture, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.7. and often elſewhere, to ſignify Evil Men, becauſe that the Wicked make up the greateſt Part of Men in this world. But this is an improper and figurative meaning of the World, Evil Men being but a part of the World, and in this Sence will better be conſider'd by us under the next general Point to be ſpoken to, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>wicked World.</hi> But <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.8. and in innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable other Places of the Scriptures, by the World is meant, that whole Frame of Nature, which we behold, and all that Variety of Creatures, which it contains, and is given us by the Bounty and Goodneſs of God, for our Uſe and Benefit.<note place="margin">

                  <p>And now the great Queſtion will be, <hi>In what Sence, and how far we muſt Renounce the World, in this Sence of the Word.</hi> And there are not ordinary Miſtakes about it; For ſome ſhall Cry out moſt grievouſly againſt this World, as the Author of all their Sin and Miſery; and therefore many have endeavour'd to fly out of it, as it were into Deſarts, living ſeparate from Mankind, and without the Conveniencies of Life, as the Hermits of Old; and into Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Monaſteries, as the ſeveral Orders of Monks and Friars, at this Day,<note place="margin">The World in this Sence is not in it ſelf Evil, but only accidentally, by Man's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or it.</note> in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But certainly the World does not deſerve to be ſo ſpitefully us'd, as the Words and Actions of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and miſtaken Men do import. For to uſe the words of a great Man,</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>The World is certainly in it ſelf Good, and is not Evil, but accidentally by Man's Abuſe of himſelf, or it.

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:151517:146"/> a great Shop, full of all ſorts of Wares, anſwerable to our Wants, or Conditions. There is Wealth, and Places, and Delights for the Senſes; and it becomes an Enemy to us, by reaſon only of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and Irregularity of thoſe Luſts and Paſſions, that are within us, and by reaſon of the Over-value, that we are apt to put upon them. They are indeed Temptations, but they are only Paſſive, as the Wedge of Gold did Paſſively Tempt <hi>Achan,</hi> but it was his own Luſt and Covetouſneſs that did him the Harm. The Rock doth not ſtrike the Ship, but the Ship ſtrikes the Rock, and breaks it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Nay, this World, as it is not Evil in it ſelf,<note place="margin">Conſider'd in it ſelf it is very Good, and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to us.</note> ſo moſt certainly it is full of Goodneſs and Benevolence to us: It ſupplies our Wants, it is accommodate to the Exigencies and Conveniencies of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it furniſhes us with various Objects, and Inſtances of the Divine Goodneſs, Liberality, Bounty; of his Power, and Majeſty, and Glory; of his Wiſdom, Providence, and Government which are ſo many Inſtructions to teach us to Know, and Adm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

And then, as to his Carriage towards Men, how often do Riches make thoſe, that have 'em, to carry themſelves with a moſt unreaſonable Haughtineſs and Diſreſpect towards Perſons of lower Fortunes, to look upon Men of little, or no Eſtates, as the Cattle only, and Vermin of the World, and to treat 'em as their Slaves and Vaſſals, as if they were not Creatures of the ſame Kind with themſelves, and had not Souls, as Precious in God's ſight, as their own? And then, as to Irreligion, and Inſolence towards God: The impious Contempt of God, and of all that is Sacred, which Men in the midſt of their Abundance do caſt upon that Bountiful Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, who <hi>Gave 'em all things Richly to Enjoy,</hi> cannot be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly deſcrib'd than in the Caſe of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Deut. 32.13, 14, 15. <hi>He made him ride on the high Places of the Earth, that he might eat the Increaſe of the Field; but</hi> Jeſhurun <hi>waxed fat and kicked; thou art waxed fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatneſs, then he forſook God which made him, and lightly eſteemed the Rock of his Salvation.</hi> But as to that Profane and Idolatrous Truſt in Riches, which is ſo Deteſtable before God, this is ſo much the natural Effect of Wealth, that very Good Men will be apt to ſlide into that very ſinful Temper of Mind, if they do not take care. <hi>In my Proſperity I ſaid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, men are Tempted to the highest Offences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and themſelves.</note> 
                     <hi>I ſhall never be removed,</hi> Holy <hi>David</hi> confeſſes it of himſelf, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 30.6. So great you ſee are the Temptations, which do alſo ariſe from the Poſſeſſion of Riches.

And, in Confidence of their Riches, Men Idolatrouſly put their Truſt in their Wealth, inſtead of the All-ſufficient God of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>But Laſtly, The great Sins of all, which Men are in danger of committing, on the account of their Riches, are thoſe, which are occaſion'd by their <hi>Lothneſs to part with,</hi> or their <hi>Fear of loſing 'em.<note place="margin">But Laſtly, the great ſins of all are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd by a Lothneſs to part with, &amp; a Fear of loſing them.

This was that Tenacious Temper of Mind, for which the Rich <hi>Dives</hi> will be for ever Infamous, as long as the Goſpel, that is, as long as the Sun and Moon endureth; and for which he is for ever irreverſibly Doom'd to Hell-Torments.

Our Bleſſed Saviour tells us, that <hi>Whoſoever he be, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh not whatever he hath for his ſake, and the Goſpels, he cannot be his Diſciple; and to leave Houſes, Lands, Poſſeſſions,</hi> and whatever worldly Enjoyments, if you will not Renounce the Goſpel it ſelf, or thoſe Truths contain'd therein, and will not embrace Errors contrary to it, is always the hard Condition that Chriſtians are put upon in Times of Perſecution. But how hard a thing is it for a Rich Man to do this? A poor Wretch may be content to leave his uncomfortable Manſion, and to reſign this laborious tedious Life, in hopes of gaining Reſt, and eternal Glory thereby, rather than ſtrain his Conſcience: But for a Rich Man to take a Farewel of his ſtately Houſes, delightful Gardens, his ſilent Grots, and ſhady Walks, his rich Furniture, goodly Farms, and his heaps of Silver; to leave theſe, and fly into Baniſhment, endure Poverty, labour with Hunger, and ſtarve with Nakedneſs; all this to preſerve a good Conſcience: It is a <hi>hard Saying,</hi> a ſhrewd Temptation! He will be apt to deſire his Settlement may be <hi>on this ſide Jordan,</hi> rather than he will paſs over the Flood, into the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> He will be very apt to <hi>build his Tabernacle</hi> on this ſide Heaven. The Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is indeed Great, and many have fallen under the Power of it. Several have paſt very ſhrewd Bruſhes in their way towards Heaven, and yet have not been able to withſtand the Shock of this Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. We have a famous Inſtance of this in the Young Man in the Goſpel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. This Perſon came to our Saviour, with a mighty Deſire to know, what he ſhould do to <hi>Inherit the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> and reckon'd up a many extraordinary Acts, that he had done already in order to it, (inſomuch that in another Goſpel it is recorded, our Saviour <hi>Loved him very much</hi>) But the Holy Jeſus told him, that if he would <hi>Be perfect, he muſt go and ſell what he had, and give to the Poor, and he ſhould have Treaſure in Heaven,</hi> and that he muſt in Poverty and Affliction come and follow him; <hi>When the young man heard that ſaying, he went away ſorrowful, for he had great Poſſeſſions,</hi> ſays the Text, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. And thus you ſee what Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations Riches will give you, whether you conſider your ſelves as <hi>Getting,</hi> as <hi>Poſſeſſing;</hi> or as <hi>Parting with,</hi> or <hi>Loſing of them.</hi>

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:151517:150"/> Reject them. We read of a peeviſh Philoſopher,<note place="margin">In general, being they are not Evil in themſelves, they are in Caſes only to be renounced by us, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we cannot without Sin, Purſue, Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, or retain them.</note> amongſt the <hi>Grecians,</hi> One <hi>Crates,</hi> who threw all his Wealth into the Sea, he would have nothing to do with it. And there are a ſort of Men amongſt the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> thoſe whom they call Begging-Friars, who Vow Poverty, and place a very great Part of their Religion in that very ſinful Trade (if there be not a very great Neceſſity for it) of Begging.

                  <p>And Firſt as to the <hi>Getting of Riches,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">As Firſt, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, no Man muſt ſo put his Heart upon 'em, as to eſteem 'em his chiefeſt Good and Happineſs.</note> you muſt not ſet your Heart upon 'em, ſo as to eſteem 'em your chiefeſt Good and Happineſs; for this is an eternal and an unalterable Rule, both in Reaſon and Religion, That the chiefeſt and moſt abſolute Good deſerves our chiefeſt Eſteem, and choiceſt Affections: And that leſſer Goods to be leſs eſteem'd and lov'd. And therefore God, and Heavenly Things being our chiefeſt Good, and the Riches of this World being Good only by Derivation from him, and that in infinitely lower Degrees, we muſt by no means ſuffer the Riches of this Life to have an equal ſhare in our Eſteem and Affections with God, and Heavenly Things. No: <hi>Mammon</hi> is too baſe a Competitor, that we ſhould <hi>divide</hi> the Empire of our Hearts betwixt God and him; <hi>No man can faithfully ſerve two Maſters; for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or elſe he will hold to the one, and deſpiſe the other.

                  <p>And, <hi>You muſt by no means labour after the Riches of this World with immoderate Care,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Nor muſt he labour after 'em with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Care, ſo as to neglect the great Duties of Religion, &amp; Devotion.</note> 
                     <hi>ſo as to neglect the great Duties of Religion and Devotion. Martha,</hi> you know, was much troubled about her Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Affairs, at a Time and Opportunity given her to hear our Saviour's Heavenly Diſcourſes, and Divine Inſtructions; and our Saviour rebuked her for it, telling her, that <hi>Mary had choſen the better Part,</hi> in laying aſide her worldly Buſineſs, to attend that more important Affair, the Enriching of her Soul, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.41, 42. And you muſt take care, leſt you alſo Incurr that, and a worſe Rebuke, by ſpending the Lord's-Day, ſet apart by Divine Appointment, wholly to the Service of God; leſt you ſpend it, I ſay, in worldly Buſineſs, and in Projects of Gain: Or indeed any Day in immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Carkings, ſo as to omit either your Family, or Private Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And muſt <hi>Seek firſt the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſneſs, and all theſe other things ſhall be added unto you,</hi> in ſuch meaſures, as ſhall be needful for you; and you muſt therefore, after lawful Endeavours, leaving the Succeſs to God, <hi>Take no further Thought for the Morrow,</hi> Matth. 6.33, 34.</p>
                  <p>But above all, in your Purſuits after this world's Wealth,<note place="margin">Eſpecially he muſt beware of Enriching himſelf by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Means.</note> 
                     <hi>You muſt beware of Enriching your ſelves by any unjuſt Means.</hi> This is call'd by the <hi>Wiſe-man, A making haſt to be Rich,</hi> becauſe that thoſe, who are bent upon unlawful Gain, think plain and honeſt Dealing too ſlow a way of encreaſing their Subſtance: But he withal tells 'em, that <hi>They,</hi> who do ſo, <hi>ſhall not be Innocent,</hi> Prov. 28.20. that is, ſhall involve themſelves in great and terrible Guilt, as has been
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:151517:151"/> ſhew'd you. And let me tell you withal, when-ever you ſhall come to caſt up your Accounts between God, and your own Souls, a Thorn will not prick your Fleſh with half that Anguiſh, as the Reflection upon an Ill-gotten Eſtate will pierce your Conſciences: So that above all things it does concern you to Renounce all falſe and deceitful ways of getting Riches, remembring how the Prophet pronounces a fearful <hi>Woe to him who buildeth his Houſe by unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and his Chambers by wrong, that uſeth his Neighbours ſervice without wages, and giveth him not for his work,</hi> Jer. 22.13. And eſpecially you muſt beware of Getting,<note place="margin">Particularly not by Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> by defrauding thoſe, who Miniſter about Holy Things. The Generality of the World do now a-days ſeem to value no Gain like this; but as it is declar'd by the Prophet <hi>Malachi,</hi> 3.8. to be the worſt ſort of Robbery; ſo it is the certain way to bring a Curſe upon all a Man's Subſtance: As on the contrary, a very free and liberal Payment of Tythes to the full Value, will bring a certain Bleſſing. All which you have fully declar'd from the Eighth, to the Thirteenth Verſes. So that in a word, all unlawful Gain, whether by Robbing God, or Man, you muſt take care of.</p>
                  <p>But if it has been your ſad Misfortune to have brought ſuch a Guilt upon your Conſciences,<note place="margin">Whoever has unjuſtly gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any thing, muſt renounce it, by make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof.</note> you muſt then Renounce thoſe Riches in the moſt proper and immediate Sence of the Word, that is, by Reſtoring ſpeedily to the full, and rather more than leſs, to all thoſe whom you have any ways Injured, as Good <hi>Zacheus</hi> did: <hi>Behold Lord, if I have taken any thing from any man by falſe Accuſation,</hi> that is, Wrongfully, <hi>I here reſtore him Four-fold,</hi> Luk. 19.8. Thus far you muſt Renounce the Riches of this World, with reſpect to the <hi>Getting of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Riches conſider'd in the Poſſeſſion, are to be renounced by paring of thoſe Superfluities, which tempt to Idleneſs and Luxury, to Pride and Inſolence, and an Idolatrous Truſt in Riches; by paring of that Super-abundance, I ſay, and beſtowing it to Pious and Charitable uſes.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> Riches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd in the Poſſeſſion, are to be renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by paring off thoſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> tempt Idleneſs and Luxury, Pride and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence, and an Idolatrous Truſt in Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and by beſtowing it to Pious and Charitable uſes.</note> Idleneſs is a Life, for which no Man living can give an account to God, or Man, there being no Man ſo Great, or ſo Rich, as that he can pretend to have been Born to live Idlely, and to be exempt from that Uſe and Service, which every Perſon owes both to Church and State, as he is a Member of both thoſe Bodies. <hi>The Eye cannot ſay unto the Hand, I have no need of thee, nor again the Head to the Feet, I have no need of you; God having ſo temper'd the Body together, that all the Members,</hi> both Comely and Uncomely, Honourable and Diſhonourable Parts, <hi>ſhould have the ſame Care one of another,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.21.24, 25. And as Idleneſs, ſo is Luxury a Crying Sin, as will appear by conſidering the fearful Doom pronounc'd by St. <hi>James</hi> to ſuch Rich Ones, as wanton it in nothing but Pleaſure. <hi>Go to now ye Rich men, weep and howl for your miſeries that ſhall come upon you, ye have lived in pleaſure on the Earth, and been wanton; ye have nouriſhed your Hearts as in a day of Slaughter,</hi> Jam. 5.1.5.</p>
                  <p>And as to Pride, For any Perſon, be he never ſo Wealthly, to be pufft up by his Eſtate, to carry it <hi>Proudly and Inſolently</hi> towards other Men of lower Fortunes; (the uſual Effect of Riches) this alſo is a thing ſeverely threaten'd in the now cited Place of St. <hi>James,</hi> viz. Chap. 5. ver. 1.5, 6.</p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:151517:151"/>
                  <p>But as to that Exalting themſelves againſt God, in an utter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of his Laws, which ſo many Rich and Great Men are ſubject to, <hi>Who, when God has fed them to the full, do then commit Adultery, and aſſemble themſelves by Troops in the Harlots houſes, and are as fed Horſes in the Morning, every One Neighing after his Neighbour's Wife; Shall I not Viſit for theſe things, ſaith the Lord, ſhall not my Soul be Avenged on ſuch a People as this?</hi> Says God by his Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> 5.7, 8, 9. Sure ſuch an inſolent Contempt of God's Laws, and haughty Pride againſt him, will moſt terribly provoke his Indignation at the laſt. And ſo,</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, will a Profane and Idolatrous Truſt in Riches, to which the wealthy Ones are ſo extreamly liable. <hi>God ſhall likewiſe deſtroy thee for ever,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.5. <hi>He ſhall take thee away, and pluck thee out of thy Dwelling-place, and root thee out of the Land of the Living.</hi> And who is this that he will ſerve ſo? <hi>Lo the Man that made not God his Strength, but Truſted in the Abundance of his Riches, and ſtrengthen'd himſelf in his Subſtance,</hi> ver. 7. The Reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men do ſo much Covet after, and ſo cloſely Hug their Riches, is becauſe they take 'em to be a ſure Security againſt all Misfortunes and Troubles, and will be a Refuge to 'em, they think, in the Days of Calamity. But alas! There is nothing more Uncertain, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed more Dangerous to the Owners thereof, than Riches. They can neither Fence off Death, nor Sufferings, but do moſt uſually bring on both, and that both from the Reaſon of the thing, as they Excite the Envy, and are a Bait to the Covetouſneſs of others to Diſpoſſeſs him, who Enjoys 'em; and by the juſt Judgment of God, when Men have unlawfully got, or abus'd 'em.</p>
                  <p>And now all this conſider'd, ſince Idleneſs and Luxury, Pride and Inſolence, and a Truſt in Riches, are ſo highly Provoking to God; and ſince the Rich are ſo extreamly liable to theſe, of all others: The Poſſeſſors of great Eſtates would do well and wiſely too, ſo far to Renounce 'em, as to Pare of thoſe Superfluities in their Fortunes, and to beſtow all that to Pious and Charitable Uſes, which Tempt 'em to ſuch Pernicious Vices. Nor is this a more hard and unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Leſſon, than what was given by our Saviour in a like Caſe. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.29. ſays he, <hi>If thy right Eye offend thee pluck it out, and caſt it from thee, for it is profitable for thee that One of thy Members ſhould periſh, and not that thy whole Body ſhould be caſt into Hell.</hi> And ſo we may ſay in this. If Superfluity and Abundance, and more than is neceſſary, to provide a Perſon of thoſe Conveniencies, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to that State and Condition, wherein Providence has Plac'd him in the World, does directly tend to thoſe Vices now nam'd; then it is much better, that with <hi>Crates</hi> he ſhould even throw away that Superfluity: For much better it is, that his worldly Wealth ſhould ſink into the bottom of the Sea, than that it ſhould ſink him both Body and Soul, in Hell. But there is no neceſſity for any Man to throw that away, which God has beſtow'd upon him for better Uſes. Take care to do Good therewith, and then it will open unto you the Gates of Heaven. In ſo doing you will Renounce thoſe Superfluities of an Eſtate, as to your own proper Uſe, but however it will return into your own Boſoms at laſt, with infinite Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and Intereſt. Which brings me in the</p>

                     <note place="margin">And Laſtly, by ſuffering the loſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, rather than Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize from the Faith.</note>Laſt Place to ſhew you, <hi>How far the Rich are to Renounce their Wealth, in Parting with it in Works of Mercy, and in ſuffering the Loſs thereof, rather than Incur Apoſtacy.</hi> And to give you my Sence thereof in a few words. God, true it is, does not always make it the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a Diſciple to <hi>Sell all that he hath, and to give it to the Poor,</hi> as he commanded him in the Goſpel, upon an extraordinary Occaſion. Nor does he always put us upon the fiery Tryal, either to leave all, or preſerve a good Conſcience. But however, there is doubtleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd a better Uſe to be made of Riches, and larger Diſtributions of what God hath Bleſt them withal, to Pious and Charitable Uſes, than moſt of our Rich Ones do commonly think. And it is alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd, that tho' we are not always put to the actual Tryal, whether we will follow Chriſt in the Adherence to Truth, and by renouncing of Error, or retain our Riches: Yet it is ever requir'd, that we ſhould be readily diſpos'd to <hi>Forſake all, and follow Chriſt,</hi> ſuppoſe there were Occaſion, which muſt be the Import of theſe words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24. <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs and follow me.</hi> Every One is not actually call'd to take up the Croſs, by abandoning his worldly Poſſeſſions, or in any other way; but the meaning muſt be, that every Diſciple muſt let this World's Goods hang very looſe about him, ſo that he could eaſily put 'em off, when call'd to it. And God, who ſearches the Heart, and tries the Reins, ſees whether we are ſo diſpos'd, or no. And, tho' he puts us not to the actual Tryal, he will however Judge us, accordingly as he ſees we are actually diſpos'd. And let this ſuffice for the preſent, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you have ſeen, how far we muſt Renounce the World in general, and alſo in that particular Inſtance of its Goods, the Riches thereof. There are ſeveral other Ingredients of which this World does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and in what Sence, and how far you muſt Renounce them, ſhall alſo, God willing, be ſhew'd you.

                  <p>And they may be reduc'd to theſe following, <hi>Nobility, or Gentility, Pre-eminence, or Authority,</hi> and Dignities and Promotions, which are call'd Poſts of Honour: Alſo an <hi>High Eſteem and Reputation</hi> amongſt Judicious, Wiſe, and Good Men, upon the account of a Perſon's Wiſdom and Vertue, or ſome worthy and glorious Action perform'd by him: Or, the <hi>Vulgar Applauſe</hi> of the Croud of Men, upon what they account Praiſe-worthy and Honourable: And laſtly, the <hi>Outward Expreſſions of Reſpect, either by Word, or Deed,</hi> uſually given upon the account of any of theſe. I ſhall conſider all theſe
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:151517:153"/> Kinds of Honour apart, and allowing to Perſons, who any-wiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Honour, all that is conſiſtent with Innocency, I will ſhew in what Sence, and how far they are to Renounce it, as its Tempts 'em to Sin againſt God, and to Trample under Foot his Authority and Laws.</p>
                  <p>And Firſt, as to <hi>Nobility, or Gentility:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> Nobility, or Gentility.</note> This is an Honour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived down upon Perſons from their Fore-fathers, who are ſuppos'd to have Ennobled their Names and Families, by ſome excellent Atchievments in Peace, or War, either in Learning, Arts, or Arms, or whatever worthy Performances, whereby they have ſignally Benefited their Country;<note place="margin">The original Nature of Nobility, or Gentility.</note> and who, upon that account, have been diſtinguiſht by certain Badges and Titles of Honour, from the Croud of Men, whoſe Anceſtors have not been ſo eminently Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and Deſerving. And ſuch Honour as this is highly agreeable both to Scripture, and Reaſon. In the Scriptures we do not only find the <hi>Princes of Iſrael, Heads of the Houſes of their Fathers, who were the Princes of the Tribes, and were over them,</hi> Numb. 7.2. but alſo that they bore ſeveral <hi>Coats of Arms</hi> for Diſtinction, which what they were, you may ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. And in Reaſon there is as great a Neceſſity, that there ſhould be a Diſtinction of <hi>Members,</hi> more or leſs Honourable in the Body Politick, as in the Natural, and therefore in both, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon ſome Members we beſtow more abundant Honour,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.23. And indeed ſuch a Diſtinction of Perſons upon the account of their Merit, or Deſert of their Families, does ſerve to raiſe the Emulation of Men, to Atchieve ſome noble and worthy Enterprize, and to ſhake off that Sloth, which would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Enfeeble their Activity. And for this reaſon it is, that God has Planted this Paſſion of Emulation in Perſons Natures, to rouze 'em up to Imitate the noble Vertues, and great Examples of Others, that they likewiſe might Tranſmit a Name worthy to be Imitated in future Generations. Such is the <hi>Original and Nature of True No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> and ſo Reaſonable and Uſeful it is in it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But as the beſt Things are liable to the worſt Abuſes;<note place="margin">The Abuſes it is ſubject to, and in what Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.</note> ſo it fares with this ſort of Honour. And the Nobleman, or Gentleman is apt to think himſelf Priviledg'd above others, to trample under Foot all Laws, both Divine and Humane; and to reckon himſelf above Reproof or Puniſhment, when he has done; to deſpiſe and oppreſs the reſt of Mankind, as if they were but a lower Rank of Creatures, and had not Souls as excellent in their Natures, and as capable of Improvements; as precious in God's ſight, and as much the Heirs of Heaven, as his own: Such are apt to fly at the greateſt Diſtance from thoſe worthy Vertues, which Ennobled their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors; and indeed to deſpiſe Religion, and its chiefeſt Vertues, as Qualities beneath 'em.</p>

                     <hi>But,</hi> Firſt, <hi>A Nobleman, or Gentleman, be he of what Rank or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſoever, muſt utterly Renounce all that Honour, which pretends to put him above the Laws of God, or Man, and beyond Reproof or Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when he has Violated either.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, be he of what Rank or Quality ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, muſt ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly renounce all that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which pretends to place him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the laws of God, or Man, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Reproof or Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when he has Violated either.</note> For ſo far is One of an Eminent Quality, from being at liberty to be an Atheiſt, or Libertine, a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious, and a lewd Liver, a breaker of the Laws of his Country, and a deſpiſer of the Diſcipline and Orders of the Church; and ſo far is he from being above Puniſhment or Reproof for ſuch like
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:151517:153"/> Violations, that he is bound, above all other Men, to be a ſtrict and orderly Liver; and upon his Failure, is more open to Reproof, and more liable to be ſeverely Puniſht: Such a one is plac'd upon a higher Form than other Men, and conſequently his Deformities and Vices are more open to publick View, and more eaſily diſcern'd; and the Multitude, which are always apt to obſerve the Faults of their Superiors, will be ſure to paſs their uſual Cenſure, <hi>How unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming is this Man's Life to his Birth and Quality, and how does he diſgrace himſelf and Family?</hi> So Injurious is he to himſelf. He is moreover by the Eminence of his Birth and Quality, as <hi>A Light put, not a under a Buſhel, but on a Candleſtick,</hi> and ſo the World, who are always apt to imitate the Manners of their Superiors, ſeeing his bad Example, will many of them Copy it out to their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; ſo miſchievous is ſuch a One amongſt Men. And laſtly, he has receiv'd far greater <hi>Talents</hi> from God, than other Men, to employ to his Glory, which if he has abus'd to his Diſhonour, he is ungrateful towards God. He has had the Examples of more noble Progenitors before his Eyes, to raiſe his Emulation; he has had the Advantages of a better Education, to improve his Knowledge; he has more Time and Leiſure to purſue it, more Riches to procure the Means of attaining it; he has more Authority to ſupport Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the Church, and he has a greater Stock of Reputation amongſt Men, to Countenance both. And having thus a greater ſhare of Talents to employ to his Maſter's Honour, proportionably a greater meaſure of improvement thereof, to the Advancement of God's Glory and Religion amongſt Men, will be requir'd at his Hands; <hi>For unto whomſoever much is given, of him ſhall much be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more,</hi> Luk. 12.48.<note place="margin">Such a One is bound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others to be a ſtrict and orderly Liver, and upon his Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure, is more open to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, and more liable to be ſeverely Puniſht.</note> And now does any Man think when he has ſo much abus'd himſelf, and Family, when his Example has been ſo miſchievous and infectious to Mankind, and when he has turn'd all the Artillery, which God has given him to fight againſt Sin, and the Devil, when he has Treacherouſly turn'd it upon God himſelf, will his Honour bear him out in this? Or does he think himſelf above the Reproof of God's Miniſters here, or the Puniſhment of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd Deity hereafter? No: He is the Man to whom Reproof does particularly belong, and accordingly <hi>Herod the Tetrarch was reproved by John the Baptiſt, for Herodias, his Brother Philip's Wife, and for the Evils, which Herod had done,</hi> Luk. 3.19. And in the World to come, ſuch a One, above all Men, will be <hi>Beaten with many ſtripes,</hi> Luk. 12.47. So much is that Honour to be Renounc'd, which pretends to put a Man above the Laws of God, or Man, or beyond Reproof or Puniſhment for the Violation of 'em.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, And ſo likewiſe is that to be <hi>Renounced and Deteſted, which exalts Perſons above their Brethren, to that degree, as to deſpiſe and oppreſs the reſt of Mankind, as if they were but a lower Rank of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and had not the ſame God to their Father, Bodies formed out of the ſame Clay, and Souls as excellent in their Natures, and as capable of Improvements; as precious in God's ſight, and as much the Heirs of Heaven, as their own.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">As alſo that which exalts Perſons above their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to that degree, as to deſpiſe and oppreſs the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as if they were but a lower Rank of Creatures, and had not the ſame God to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Bodies Formed out of the ſame Clay, &amp; Souls as Excellent in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and as capable of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements; as precious in God's Sight, and as much the Heirs of Heaven, as their own.</note> This is indeed obſerv'd to be, for the moſt part, the Property of thoſe only of <hi>

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:151517:154"/> of Fortune, ſo as not to know their mean Beginning; or whether it be, that their Fathers being rais'd to their Greatneſs, meerly by Vertue of their ſucceſsful Fortunes in the World, not for any noble and worthy Performances, theſe have not that Vein of Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, Largeneſs of Soul, Generoſity, Courteſy, and Liberality, running in the Blood, as it were, of ſome Families, whoſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility was founded in ſome noble Exploits of Vertue: Whatever may be the reaſon, it is generally obſerv'd, that your New Gentry are apt, above others, to carry it with an unreaſonable Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs and Diſreſpect towards their poorer Brethren. But alas! There is no Ground in the World for this Diſtance, nor that Slavery they put 'em to. <hi>Have we not one Father, and hath not one God made us,</hi> Mal. 2.10. And was it not out of the ſame Lump of Clay, that he made one Veſſel to <hi>Honour, and another to Diſhonour?</hi> And when this <hi>Earthly Tabernacle of ours ſhall be diſſolved,</hi> who ſhall be able to diſtinguiſh betwixt the Duſt of Princes, and their meaneſt Vaſſals? And is not the Soul of the pooreſt <hi>Indian</hi> Slave, as Spiritual and Immortal, as that of the Richeſt Merchant in <hi>Europe?</hi> And had it but the Education, which our Europians have, it is capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving as clear Notions of God, and of Religion, and of Vertue, as any of us all. And no doubt, were it adorn'd therewith, and ſo had the Image of God conſiſting in theſe Graces, reſtor'd within it, it would be as Precious and Dear to him, and be receiv'd into thoſe Manſions of Bliſs, from which thoſe proud Tyrants over their Fellow-Creatures Liberty, will certainly be Excluded, if they continue to treat 'em with ſuch Diſtance and Slavery. Sure I am, the Poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> is now in <hi>Abraham's Boſom,</hi> when the Rich and Noble <hi>Dives,</hi> who treated him not with that Reſpect and Kindneſs, as he did his Dogs, is ſcorching in the Flames of Hell. All which conſider'd, it does become the higheſt in Birth and Quality, to carry it with all due Humility and Courteſy to the loweſt, and to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and Abandon thoſe Thoughts of Honour and Quality, which thruſt away their Fellow-Servants to the ſame God, ſo far off 'em, tho' they may not have the Pretence of the Phariſee for ſo doing, nor can ſay to 'em, <hi>Come not near me, I am Holier than thou.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But,</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Thoſe Perſons ought indeed, even to renounce all Pretenſions to Honour, who have degenerated from thoſe worthy Qualities, which Ennobled their Anceſtors.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Such ought even to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who have degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from thoſe wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>thy Qualities, which Enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled their Anceſtors.</note> The true Nobility of thoſe, who are really of Birth, or Quality, was founded, as I have told you, in the Heroick and extraordinary Vertues of their Anceſtors; and therefore their <hi>Quality</hi> cannot be ſuppos'd to remain with 'em, when thoſe Vertues, which gave Being to it, are departed from 'em. But ſo it is, that none are half ſo apt to Pride themſelves in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and to talk ſo much of their Pedigree, as thoſe who have the leaſt of any true Worth remaining in 'em: And ſure, it is a ſign they have but little of their own, who do ſo much value themſelves upon others Deſervings; and ſeem to have nothing to Brag of, but borrowed Titles. <hi>We have Abraham to our Father,</hi> was the conſtant Cry of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they had leaſt of the Faith and Vertues of <hi>Abraham.</hi> However, as apt as ſuch are to aſſume this Honour to themſelves, there is no reaſon in the World, but what was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd by the Merits of others, ſhould be forfeited by their ill De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts,

The Honour of my Houſe beginneth with me, and the Honour of thine endeth with thee, ſaid a worthy Commander, in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> to a debaucht Wretch, who upbraided him with the Meanneſs of his Parentage.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>And ſuch ought alſo, even to Renounce all Pretenſions to Honour, amongſt Chriſtians at leaſtwiſe, who deſpiſe Religion and its chiefeſt Vertues, as Qualities beneath them.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Laſtly, and ſuch ought to Renounce all Pretenſions to Honour, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians at leaſt-wiſe, who deſpiſe Religion and its chiefeſt Vertues, as Qualities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath 'em.</note> And yet thoſe are the Perſons, who take themſelves to be the only Men of Honour, who can talk moſt Atheiſtically and Profanely, whoſe Life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is made up of Lewdneſs and Debauchery; and as to thoſe grand diſtinguiſhing Graces of Chriſtianity, Humility, Meekneſs, and a patient Enduring of Injuries and Affronts, who count them a meer Jeſt, which Men of Quality and Honour, it is impoſſible, ſhould ſubmit to. But be it ſo, only let 'em withal conſider, that <hi>Not many mighty, not many Noble were called; but the baſe things of the World, and things which are deſpiſed, hath God choſen, yea and things which are not, to bring to nought things which are,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.26.28. And what then ſignifies their Honour, when God deſpiſes it?</p>
                  <p>But really it is not ſo, that your profligate and lewd Livers, be their Birth, or Quality never ſo Great, are Honour'd and Reſpected amongſt Men; for whilſt they continue in a mean and vile Slavery to their baſeſt Luſts, they are not only in truth and reallity miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and wretched Caitiffs: But whatever they think of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they are indeed in the Eyes of others moſt Hateful and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible. True it is, the greateſt Part of Men (and Pity it is, that ſo many amongſt Chriſtians ſhould ſtill remain ſo Carnally-minded) do look upon the Man, who will not revenge an Affront, to be mean Spirited, and ſcarcely a Gentleman; and the deſperate Duelliſt is the more Honourable and Heroick in the Eye of the World: Yet thoſe who are throughly ſeaſon'd with Religion, and Wiſdom's Dictates, have other Thoughts and Apprehenſions of ſuch a One, and count him the only Perſon of true Courage, and of a great Soul, who can deſpiſe the vain Opinions of the Croud, in the Purſuit of real Vertue. And above all, the Meek and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving Chriſtian, has this Honour, that he has an eaſy Acceſs to the Throne of God, can come into his Preſence with Confidence and Aſſurance, whilſt the other, tho' the Greateſt Man on Earth for Quality, dares not Approach him, without Trembling and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. And yet if vain Men will give the Honour here to thoſe, who are moſt Contemptible in the ſight of God,<note place="margin">But if ſuch are accounted Honourable by vain Men, they are deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable in the Eyes both of God, and of all Wiſe and Good Men.</note> (it is very unfit it ſhould be ſo amongſt Chriſtians) however let the Humble and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:151517:155"/> Meek content himſelf with this, That here on Earth he has the Approbation and Eſteem of all Wiſe and Good Men, and ſhall receive in Heaven, from the unerring Judgment of God, a Teſtimony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole Quire of Saints and Angels, to his infinite and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Honour and Glory; a Teſtimony, I ſay, which will far Exalt him above the Higheſt of Mortal Men, who conſider their own Quality, more than God's Glory, and prefer an empty Notion of Honour, before the real and ſubſtantial Graces of God's Spirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Summ how far Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is to be Renounced.</note>In a word, and to ſumm up what has been ſpoke to this Point, <hi>Paternal Honour</hi> is indeed in it ſelf Uſeful and Valuable, as it puts before Men's Eyes the worthy Deeds of their Anceſtors, and as it inſpires 'em to an Imitation of 'em in the moſt excellent and noble Inſtances, and Strains of Vertue. But ſo far as Men's Opinion of their Birth, or Quality, pretends to put 'em above the Laws of God, or Man, and beyond Reproof, or Puniſhment, when they have vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated either; and when it Exalts 'em above their Brethren, to that Degree, as to deſpiſe and oppreſs the reſt of Mankind, as if in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of themſelves, they were no better than Brute Creatures: Theſe are no other than meer <hi>Paganiſh and Heatheniſh Notions of Honour,</hi> and muſt be Renounced and Deteſted by every Chriſtian. And indeed thoſe ought, even to Renounce all Pretenſions to any Honour, who have baſely degenerated from thoſe noble and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Qualities, which Ennobled their Anceſtors, and did conſtitute them Honourable. But eſpecially ſuch ought to Renounce all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to Honour, amongſt Chriſtians at leaſt-wiſe, who deſpiſe Religion, and its chiefeſt Vertues, as Qualities beneath 'em. So that thus you have at length ſeen, in what Sence, and how far <hi>Paternal Honour</hi> is to be Renounced, that Honour which is derived upon Perſons, from their Fore-fathers by Nature.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, And now I am in like manner to conſider <hi>Civil Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> In what ſence, and how far Civil Honour is to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced; whether the Favour of Princes, or the Effects of their Favour, Poſts of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</note> that which is derived upon Perſons, from the Fathers of their Country, or thoſe who have the ſupreme Power and Authority in a Land, and are next under God, the ſole Fountain of this ſort of Honour. And it is either that, which is the Cauſe of farther Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, viz. <hi>The Favour of Princes;</hi> or the Honours themſelves, which they Confer'd upon Perſons deſerving their Favours, as <hi>Pre-eminence</hi> and <hi>Authority, Dignities</hi> and <hi>Promotions,</hi> which are uſually call'd <hi>Poſts of Honour:</hi> As alſo thoſe <hi>Titles</hi> and <hi>Diſtinctions,</hi> which do commonly accompany, and go along therewith, and are the Effect of Princes Favours.</p>
                  <p>Now as to both theſe, there is no doubt, but in themſelves they are Good and Uſeful, and may be very advantagious to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of Religion; for the more a Man is in his <hi>Prince's Favour,</hi> and the greater is his Authority and Truſt; the more he is ſupported with Power and Pre-eminence, and the greater Figure he makes in the World, the more capable he ſhall be of protecting true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, of rewarding and encouraging Piety and Vertue, and of diſcountenancing and caſheering Wickedneſs and Vice, as was ſeen in the Favour of <hi>Heſter</hi> and <hi>Mordecai,</hi> with King <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> Heſt. 8. But then except the Mind be firſt well ſeaſon'd with Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion and Vertue, and ballaſted with Humility, Princes Favours, High Places, Precedences and Titles give great Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:151517:155"/> to ſeveral Sins, and that both in the Getting, Poſſeſſing, and Loſing thereof.</p>
                  <p>Theſe kind of Honours, and outward Glories, are dazling and bewitching Things;<note place="margin">Theſe kind of Honours and outward Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching Things</note> they draw the Eyes of whole Crouds upon 'em, gazing, and admiring, and almoſt adoring thoſe, who are Inveſted with 'em. They bring many humble Petitioners to wait upon 'em; and theſe are the Men, who keep the World in ſubjection and awe under 'em. And therefore in obtaining a Prince's Favour, many are tempted to the groſſeſt Flattery, in keeping it to the moſt ſervile and ſinful Compliances; and rather than loſe it, to Sacrifice Innocence, and a good Conſcience. And as to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours themſelves, the Glory thereof tempts ſome to graſp after 'em, who have no Abilities, nor Skill to manage 'em; the Denial often cauſes thoſe, who have real Abilities, but know it too well, to turn <hi>Male-contents</hi> and <hi>Mutineers,</hi> to the Shocking many times of Church and State.

There are ſeveral Inſtances in the Scripture of Good and Wiſe Men, which ſhew you how, and in what Caſe it is neceſſary for Men, ſo far to deny themſelves, as to Renounce their Favours, amongſt which, take that of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, inſtead of many.

Nevertheleſs this Holy Man was ſo far from flattering of him, that he did not ſtick to Reprove him for his Inceſt, <hi>and for all the Evils he had done,</hi> Luk. 3.19. tho' to the Loſs of that Prince's Favour, and his own Life, <hi>Mar.</hi> 6.27.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Proceed we next to conſider,<note place="margin">Nor Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Effects of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, High Places, and Titles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</note> what is neceſſary to be done with reſpect to the Effect of Prince's Favours, thoſe <hi>Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Poſts,</hi> the <hi>Pre-eminence</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> the <hi>Dignities</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions,</hi> to which they do Advance thoſe, whom they Favour; and thoſe <hi>Titles of Honour and Diſtinction,</hi> which do uſually go along therewith. And in the <hi>Obtaining</hi> of theſe Poſts of Honour, and Places of Truſt and Power;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>There muſt be no Graſping at that, which is above a Man's Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities and Abilities to manage to the Publick Good.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> In the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of theſe, no man muſt graſp at that, which is above his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities and Abilities to manage to the Publick Good.</note> For any Perſon, out of a vain Opinion he has conceived of his own Parts and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:151517:156"/> to undertake Buſineſs he is not able to Perform, and to meddle in things he does not underſtand, is a great Injury both to himſelf, and others; to himſelf, in expoſing his own Inſufficiency, which in a lower Station would have lain hid, and never been Cenſur'd, nor Reproach'd. He does injure others thereby in pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judgment and Juſtice, through his Unskilfulneſs, in not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching Men with quickneſs and dexterity in their lawful Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Buſineſs, and by keeping out thoſe, who would diſcharge the Duties of ſuch Offices and Places,<note place="margin">This miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous to the State.</note> much more to the Benefit and Satisfaction of the Publick.</p>
                  <p>But this Ambitious and Pragmatical Humour of <hi>Climbing</hi> where they are not <hi>Call'd,</hi> is moſt of all miſchievous to the Church,<note place="margin">This miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous to the Church.</note> when Perſons undertake to be Teachers of others, who have not Learnt themſelves; ſuch were thoſe of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Who deſired to be Teachers of the Law, when they underſtood neither what they ſaid, nor whereof they affirmed,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.7. And ſuch were ſome great Pretenders to Illumination and Knowledge in the Apoſtles Time, of whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> complains thus, <hi>Theſe are Wells without Water, Clouds carried by a Tempeſt,</hi> viz. From one dangerous Error to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by every Wind of Doctrine, as Clouds are from one place to another, by a tempeſtuous Wind, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.17.</p>
                  <p>But the Pſalmiſt was far from this pragmatical and medling Temper, Pſal. 131.1. <hi>Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine Eyes lofty, neither do I exerciſe my ſelf in great matters, or things too high for me.</hi> Much leſs does it become others to be ſo; but all muſt ſo far Renounce (as great as is the Temptation) the moſt Honourable Poſts, as to decline and refuſe thoſe they are not able to manage to the Satisfaction of their own Conſciences, and the Publick Weal. And it would be happy for the World if all would do ſo.</p>
                  <p>But above all, this Modeſty in declining thoſe Undertakings they are not fitted for, becomes the Laity, with reſpect to their Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of others, whom it does not become <hi>To think more highly of themſelves, than they ought to think</hi> (as they do who ſet up for Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who had not an Education for that Purpoſe) <hi>but to think ſoberly, according as God has dealt to every Man the meaſure of Faith,</hi> Rom. 12.3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Nor Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ought Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the beſt Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Abilities be over-eager and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in their Suits and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to thoſe, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow them.</note>Secondly, And in the obtaining of theſe Poſts of Honour and Power, <hi>Perſons of the beſt Capacities and Abilities, muſt not be over-eager and importunate in their Suits and Applications to thoſe, who beſtow them;</hi> but having modeſtly made their Court to their Superiors, muſt contentedly receive their Denial. It is the Ambition of Great Men, ſtriving with one another for the higheſt Places of Truſt and Power in the Common-wealth, that cauſes Factions, and Civil Wars, to the Deſtruction of their Native Country. And it is the Pride of ſome, who over-valuing their own Abilities and Parts, and thinking they are Injured, in not being Prefer'd to the higheſt Dignities and Promotions in the Church, has cauſed thoſe <hi>Schiſms and Separations</hi> in it; ſuch chooſing rather to be <hi>Ring-leaders</hi> of a Party, than Subject to, and <hi>Dependant</hi> on any. But tho' theſe publick Poſts in Church, or State may be modeſtly ſought by thoſe, who are able to weild 'em, and need not be renounc'd and declin'd by Men of Parts and Abilities, when duly call'd thereto:
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:151517:156"/> Yet none of the greateſt Capacities ought violently to thruſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into 'em, to the Diſturbance of Church, or State, <hi>Leſt they periſh in the Gain-ſaying of Korah,</hi> who with his Companions, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> unduly and factiouſly ſeeking the Prieſt-hood, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.10. Provok'd God in ſo fearful a manner, that <hi>The Earth opened her mouth, and ſwallowed them up, and their Houſes, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their Goods,</hi> ver. 32. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences and Effects of Faction and Schiſm, are ſo very bad, that it is not to be wonder'd, God ſhould ſo remarkably Puniſh it, as he did, to the Example of others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Wherefore a Perſon of the beſt Capacities and Abilities, if after ſome reaſonable Expectations, and a modeſt Importunity, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet hope to prevail, he muſt ſubmit to Authority and Order, acknowledg God's Providence in it, poſſeſs his Soul in Patience, and think that for ſome ſecret Corruption in himſelf, or for ſome other juſt Cauſe, God is pleas'd that he ſhould not at all, or not yet ſucceed in his Suit.</q> So that thus you ſee, how in the Purſuit of Civil Honour, as High Places, and Poſts of Honour, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, Dignities, and Promotions, that no Man muſt graſp at thoſe, which he has not Abilities, or Skill to manage; nor muſt Perſons of greateſt Abilities turn Male-contents and Mutineers againſt the Government, in Church, or State, when defeated in their Aims: But as they may modeſtly endeavour their own Advancement, ſo they muſt contentedly receive a Denial, when for Reaſons, beſt known to their Superiors, they are put by their Pretenſions. And this is all that is proper for me to ſpeak as to the <hi>Renouncing</hi> of this ſort of Honour; it being not my Buſineſs to <hi>Catechize</hi> my Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, but rather to Inſtruct you, that you may be obedient both to God, and Them. To proceed then,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>There is another ſort of Honour, conſiſting in the high E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem and Reputation, on which the wiſe and vertuous Part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind have of a Perſon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>III.</hi> How far, and in what Sence, that Honor which conſiſts in the high Eſteem and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wiſe and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous part of Mankind is to be renounced.</note> 
                     <hi>occaſion'd by the excellent Qualities, and divine Graces ſhining in him, or upon the account of ſome extraordinary Actions performed by him.</hi> And this indeed is a Subject, which it concerns all of you to have well ſtated to you, there being no Chriſtian but has, or ought to have a good Reputation, for his good and excellent Qualities. And by what meaſures he ought to <hi>Gain,</hi> to <hi>Enjoy,</hi> or to <hi>Retain</hi> it; and when, how far, and in what Sence he is bound to deny himſelf in, or to decline it, is what belongs therefore to every One to be ſatisfy'd about.</p>
                  <p>Now this is that Honour, which the Wiſe-man calls a <hi>Good Name,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">This is what the Wiſe-man calls a Good Name, and is more valuable than Riches, or precious Ointments.</note> Prov. 22.1. and tells us, it <hi>is rather to be choſen, than great Riches, and that loving Favour is better than Silver and Gold.</hi> And yet to give us a higher Commendation of it, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.1. he tells us, that a <hi>Good Name is better than precious Ointment.</hi> Now that he does com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and prefer it to precious Ointment, the reaſon very likely is this, Becauſe in the firſt place, precious Ointment was a moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Treaſure in the Eaſtern Nations, as appears by <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s ſhewing it in a vain Oſtentatious manner amongſt the reſt of his choiceſt Treaſures, thoſe in the <hi>Houſe of his precious things,</hi> to the Babyloniſh Ambaſſadours, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20.13. Next it was what was uſed in the Conſecration of Perſons to the higheſt Dignities and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:151517:157"/> Employments, as to the Pre-eminence of a King, and the Office of the High Prieſt-hood, as you will ſee, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.32. and 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.16. It was what caſt forth, far and near, a moſt fragrant and delicious Scent to the Comfort of others, and of thoſe, who were Anointed with it; for no ſooner had <hi>Mary anointed the Feet of Jeſus, with her coſtly Ointment, but the houſe was filled with the Odour of it,</hi> Joh. 12.3. Oyls and Ointments were what Wreſtlers were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly wont to uſe to prepare 'em for the Combat; for being of a piercing Nature, when Chaſed in, they would ſupple the Joints, and ſtrengthen the Sinews very much, <hi>It ſhall enter like Oyl into thy Bones,</hi> Pſal. 109.18. and thereby greatly enable the Body for Action, make it Nimble, and Vigorous, and fit for noble Exerciſes. And laſtly, they were wont anciently to Embalm the Bodies of their Dead therewith, as you may ſee, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.14. to preſerve 'em, even after Death, from Stench and Corruption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">It is a more peculiar Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing than any the greateſt Treaſures, and procures better Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to our Perſons and Eſtates.</note>And now the Advantages of a Good Name have ſomething there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in reſembling, but indeed far exceeding each of theſe, ſo as to render it much better than precious Ointment. For in the firſt place, an excellent Reputation and Fame for extraordinary Perfections, Divine Graces, and vertuous Performances, is infinitely more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable than the moſt precious Treaſures; for beſides that, it is a more peculiar Bleſſing, than large Mannors and Poſſeſſions, Banks of Gold, or Silver, than Indian Stones, and all things that are accounted precious by Worldlings and Uſurers; for theſe are things which are common to the worſt, as well as beſt of Men: Beſides this, I ſay, an high Eſteem and Reputation for Goodneſs, is a better Security by far, than the greateſt Wealth. Now the Fundamental reaſon of ſome Men's amaſſing ſo much Wealth together, is becauſe they think they ſhall provide thereby againſt all the ill Events of Fortune, and ſhall have wherewithal to ſend for themſelves in times of difficulty and ſcarcity of Friends. But whereas in Dearths, Famines, Perſecutions, and Invaſions, the more Wealthy any Man is, the more he is the Object of Envy, and ſubject to Rapine and Violence: The very Reputation of Uprightneſs and Integrity, Goodneſs, Mercy, Charitableneſs, will be a ſafe Retreat and Shelter againſt the Storm. And this alone has deliver'd many a One from Injuries, and Barbarous Uſage, whom bolted Doors, and barr'd Gates, and Armed Men to guard 'em, could not protect againſt the Inſults of an Enraged Multitude, and the Plunders of an Intruding Souldiery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">It is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification to the Epiſcopal Promotion.</note>Next a good Reputation, and an Honourable Eſteem amongſt Men for worthy Qualities, is a neceſſary Qualification of thoſe, who are to be Conſecrated to the Dignity of Biſhops, and of the Prieſt-hood, it being requir'd that ſuch <hi>muſt have a good Report of thoſe, who are without,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.1. Credit and Reputation do yield an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Comfort to a Man's own ſelf,<note place="margin">It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to a Man's own ſelf.</note> when he has the Approbation of Wiſe and Good Men, giving the ſame Teſtimony as his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to his worthy Deſigns and Performances. For which reaſon the Wiſe-man tells us, Prov. 15.13. <hi>That a good Report maketh the Bones fat,</hi> whereas a Perſon labouring under the Infamy of ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Vices, has both his own Conſcience, and other men's Contempt of him, piercing him to the very Soul. And with reſpect to others,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:151517:157"/> A <hi>Good Name</hi> ſends forth a Savour more ſweet,<note place="margin">And ſmells ſweet in the World.</note> than the moſt <hi>preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ointments,</hi> to the Delight of all that are round about him; whereas the very Name of an Unjuſt Oppreſſor and Exactor, of a Riotous and Debaucht Liver, of a Knaviſh, or Perfidious Villain, is a Nuſance and Offence to the Neighbourhood he dwells in, and he is Hated farther than he was ever ſeen.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall I ſay? A Good Name and Reputation in the World,<note place="margin">It renders a Perſon capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of doing Good in it.</note> renders a Perſon capable of doing Good amongſt Men. It gives Weight to his Counſels, Authority to his Reproofs: Nay, and not only his Preſence, but the very Imagination that he is Preſent, is enough to give a Check to any baſe and unworthy Action, or wicked Deſign. <hi>Becauſe I delivered the Poor that cryed, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs, and him that had none to help him, unto me men gave Ear and waited, and kept Silence at my Counſel,</hi> Job 29.12.21. Whereas if a Perſon of known, or but ſuſpected Vices, tho' Backt with the Power of a Maſter, of a Parent, nay of a Magiſtrate, if ſuch a One pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to correct Sin, or to enjoin the ſtrict Obſervation of any Duty, that Part of Religion is thought the worſe of, and ſlighted the more for his concerning himſelf about it. And as a Good Name renders a Man capable of doing much Good, ſo to have the Approbation of others to his worthy Deſigns, puts Life and Vigour into his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances for the Publick.<note place="margin">And active in Promoting it.</note> It makes him Active and Zealous in the Proſecution of 'em, and gives Refreſhment to his tired Thoughts and Spirits, under the Fatigues of compaſſing 'em. And to Crown all, when ſuch a One comes to Die, his Death is lamented as a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Loſs, or ſome Judgment befall'n the Age, or Place, which was not worthy of him. His Memory is ſweet and precious, whereas that of the Infamous ſtinks worſe than his very Carcaſs; or as the Wiſe-man ſays, <hi>The Memory of the Juſt is bleſſed, but the Name of the Wicked ſhall rot,</hi> Prov. 10.7. So Valuable in it ſelf, is that ſort of Honour, which conſiſts in the high Eſteem and Reputation of the Wiſe and Vertuous Part of Mankind, concerning a Perſon, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by the excellent Qualities and divine Graces ſhining in him, or upon the account of ſome extraordinary Actions perform'd by him. And yet for your farther Satisfaction,<note place="margin">A deſire of Reputation, and Credit, is a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in our Natures by God.</note> that it is not only in it ſelf a valuable Bleſſing, but may with due Regulations be deſir'd, enjoy'd, and carefully retain'd by us, I am to tell you, That God himſelf, who is not the Author of Sin, has implanted in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of every Man a love of his Credit, and a deſire to have a Good Name amongſt Wiſe and Vertuous Perſons; and this the Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom has done, that this deſire of Credit and Reputation might be a Spur to excite us to Vertuous Performances, and a Bridle to reſtrain us from laſhing out into Sinful Extravagances. Hence that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Wilt thou not be afraid of the Power? Do that which is Good, and thou ſhalt have Praiſe of the ſame,</hi> Rom. 13.3.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, Laſtly, It is a Duty incumbent upon all Chriſtians, to preſerve their Reputation <hi>untainted,</hi> and, as much as poſſible, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpected</hi> of Evil.<note place="margin">And to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted and unſuſpected of Evil, is a Duty enjoin'd us by his Laws.</note> So the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Be blameleſs, ye Sons of God, without Rebuke, in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe Nation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom ſhine ye as Lights in the world.</hi> And in the 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.22. we are Enjoin'd to <hi>Abſtain from all Appearance of Evil.</hi> Some will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, ſo they can but Approve their Conſciences to God, they care
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:151517:158"/> not what Men ſay of 'em. But beſides that, ſeldom any grow ſhameleſs and regardleſs of their Credit, till they have loſt all ſence of Conſcience, as well as of their Honour: This is at beſt but a very uncharitable Saying. It is every Man's Duty indeed, in the firſt place, to take care of doing any thing, that is in it ſelf Evil, and by which God is offended; and if he cannot diſcharge his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to him in a Good thing, without incurring the Offence and and Cenſures of Men, he muſt in ſuch Caſe be content to approve his Actions to God only. But in Charity to other Men's Souls, we muſt alſo with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 24.16. <hi>Exerciſe our ſelves to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a Conſcience void of offence, as towards God, ſo towards men,</hi> by giving no occaſion to ſuſpect us of Evil, and that becauſe of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Offence, <hi>Leſt our liberty become a ſtumbling Block to them that are Weak, and an occaſion of falling in our Brother's way,</hi> which we are Caution'd againſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.13. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. <q>Beſides, that if a Perſon be of ill Fame, tho' he may not deſerve it, all his Speeches and Actions ſhall be ill Interpreted, no Man regards what he ſays, or does, his Propoſals ſhall be ſuſpected, his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Rebukes, tho' wholſome and juſt, ſcorn'd and deſpis'd; the Man he ſpeaks for, the ſide he adheres to, the Cauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends, and the Buſineſs he manages ſhall ſuffer Prejudice, and ſpeed the worſe for the ill Opinion is held of him.

For the natural Deſire of Honour and Credit amongſt Men, is apt to make us too eagerly to deſire Praiſe, making our own Glory the main End of the Good we do, or at leaſt-wiſe to make us deſire more than is proportionable to our Deſerts. When poſſeſt of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and Eſteem, we are apt to take it wholly to our ſelves, and not to refer it to God, to whom the Glory of all that is Good in us, does properly belong; and to make it an Inſtrument of our own Advancement only, neglecting to uſe the Authority, which our Credit and Reputation in the World does give us, to diſcountenance Irreligion, and to encourage Piety in the World. And ſometimes Perſons do ſo much over-value their Good Name and Reputation amongſt Men, as to fly to undue Means of preſerving it; nay, to prefer the Eſteem of Men more than the Honour, that cometh from God: In all which Caſes there is great occaſion for that Renunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and Self-denial, with reſpect to that Honour, which conſiſts in an High Eſteem and Reputation amongſt Men.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, Perſons, who have a great Reputation and Eſteem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men, upon the account of ſome worthy Performances, <hi>Muſt beware of taking the Honour thereof wholly to themſelves, and of not Transferring it to God,</hi> to whom the Glory of all that is Good in us, or excellently perform'd by any of us, does properly belong.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>III.</hi> We muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects given us for any worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, wholly to our ſelves, and of not transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it to God, to whom the Glory of all that is Good in us, does properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.</note> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> tho' <hi>He labour'd more abundantly</hi> in the ſaving of Men's Souls, <hi>than all</hi> the reſt of the Apoſtles, yet was ſo far from taking the Glory thereof to himſelf, that he corrects it with a <hi>Not I, but the Grace of God, which was with me,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. And ſo muſt all of us do, and inſtead of Glorying in our ſelves, muſt Glory in the Lord, and ſay, <hi>Not unto us, not unto us, but unto thy Name be the Praiſe,</hi> Pſal. 115.1. And the reaſon thereof is, that the good Temper of our Souls is wrought in us by the Grace of his Holy Spirit; and if we ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh any worthy Deſign, beſides that, it is owing to his Grace aſſiſting us, it is owing alſo to his Providence, which orders all thoſe lucky Hits, and favourable Circumſtances, and all thoſe other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, whereby we do bring it to Perfection: For <hi>Every good and perfect Gift cometh from above,</hi> Jam. 1.17. And, <hi>What is it that we have not received?</hi> 1 Cor. 4.7. <q>We are not forbid to receive Honour,

                        <hi>IV.</hi> We muſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor making a Reputation for Religion an Inſtrument only to our own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement.</note>Fourthly, You muſt abhor that vain Hypocriſy of thoſe, who make the Reputation for Religion a meer Engine to ſcrew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up into Places of Power, and an Inſtrument to promote their Trade only; but muſt chiefly uſe that Authority, which your Credit and Reputation for Religion may give you, to diſcountenance Vice, and to encourage Vertue in the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>You muſt Renounce and Abhor,</hi> I ſay, <hi>that prophane Hypocriſy of thoſe, who make their Reputation for Religion a meer Engine to ſcrew themſelves up into places of Power, and an Inſtrument to promote their Trade only.</hi> This is the known Policy of a great many, who when they have a mind to uſurp the Places of their Governours, put up to be great Zealots for Reformation of Religion and Manners; and when they have a deſign to Engroſs to themſelves all the Trade of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, turn over to ſome Demure and Phariſaical Sect, that makes greater Pretences and outward Shews of Godlineſs, than their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, but modeſt Neighbours. But for any Perſon to preſume to make ſo ſacred and venerable a Thing, as Religion really is, a meer Tool and Engine to mount themſelves into the higheſt Poſts and Promotions, into Buſineſs and Trades, is ſo Sacrilegious, ſo Prophane an Impiety, ſuch an Aggravated, ſuch a provoking Pitch of Wickedneſs, that if Hell be heated, as the <hi>Babylonian Furnace</hi> was, <hi>ſeven times</hi> hotter than ordinary, for any ſort of Sinners, ſurely it muſt be for thoſe, who do proſtitute the Honour of God and Religion to ſuch vile Purpoſes. And this therefore is a Practice, which muſt of all things in the World be deteſted by you. Certain it is, the mild JESUS was never known to utter Himſelf with ſo much Indignation and Anger, as towards thoſe ſort of Men, who made the Pretences of Religion, a meer Inſtrument to ſerve their Ambition and Covetouſneſs, <hi>Wo unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hypocrites, for ye devour Widows Houſes, and for a pretence make long Prayers, therefore ye ſhall receive the greater Damnation,</hi> Matth. 23.14. So that far be it from any of you, to make ſo Sacred and Venerable a thing, as Religion, an Inſtrument only of Ambition and getting Wealth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">But muſt uſe the Authority our Credit gives us to diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance Vice, and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Vertue in the world.</note>
                     <hi>But you muſt uſe that Authority, which your Credit and Reputation for Religion may give you, to diſcountenance Vice, and to encourage Vertue in the World.</hi> A Perſon of approv'd Sincerity, and of known Piety, has upon that very account, a very great Power over the Hearts and Minds of Men, as I have told you; ſo that he can eaſily mould 'em into the like Temper with himſelf, if he will but ſeriouſly apply himſelf to that Purpoſe. And to this purpoſe therefore you muſt uſe that Credit, Reputation, and Authority you ſhall have with men, who think well and honourably of you, namely, to pull 'em back from running headlong in a Courſe of Sin, and as Allurements to entice 'em to follow your Example in thoſe Vertues and good Parts, for which you your ſelves ſhall be ſo Commendable. It is a Talent God has committed to you, to Trade withal for his Glory, and if

                  <p>Fifthly, As valuable as is a Good Name and Reputation amongſt Men, <hi>You muſt Renounce all undue Means of preſerving it;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>V.</hi> As valuable as is a Good Name and Reputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men, we muſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due means of preſerving it.</note> In which Rank I ſhall place, not only Duelling, that moſt Barbarous and Unchriſtian Cuſtom amongſt the Great Ones:<note place="margin">Such are Duelling upon the account of ſlanders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the great Ones.</note> But alſo going to Law upon every Scandal, ſo common amongſt the Ordinary ſort of People when the Slander one another. As to the former, That Perſon, who Challenges his Slanderer to give him Satisfaction, as he calls it, in the way of Duel, he ſeems to me to take the ready way to confirm the World in the Opinion, that he was not Injur'd. The worſt his Adverſary could ſay of him, was ſomething which ſpoke him a very Ill Man; and herein he goes about to prove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the worſt of Men, even a Murderer of his Neighbour, and a <hi>Felo de,</hi> and conſequently one that might not be unlikely to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any other Wickedneſs. But if it ſhould take off the Scandal from him, in the Opinion of a fooliſh World, what Comfort will that afford, when it is certain, that <hi>No Murderer hath eternal Life abiding in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.15.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it ſo agreeable to that forbearing and forgiving Temper,<note place="margin">Going to Law thereupon u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual amongst common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> which ſhould be in every Chriſtian, to go to Law upon words of Slander. <hi>Now therefore there is utterly a Fault amongſt you, becauſe ye go to Law one with another; why do you not rather take Wrong?</hi> That is, in matters of Treſpaſs and Fraud, if the Loſs may be ſupported, or in Caſes of Slander, wherein generally ſpeaking, there is a much more effectual way of clearing an injur'd Innocence, than by Impleading of the Slanderer before a Magiſtrate: Why in ſuch Caſes do you not rather take Wrong? I ſay, in ſuch Caſes there is generally a much more effectual way of clearing an injur'd Innocence, than by Impleading of the Slanderer before a Magiſtrate. For beſides that, this ſort of Lawing ſeems in moſt, a piece of Revenge in the Party traduc'd, upon his Accuſer, for diſcovering ſome ſecret Wickedneſs, which he was aſham'd to have publiſht, rather than with any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, or Hopes of clearing his Innocence; inſomuch that he who comes off Triumphantly from the Juſtice of Peace, is ſeldom the better thought of in the Neighbourhood, and ſtill they will be apt to think it was a Work of Darkneſs, and only wanted a ſufficient Proof: Beſides this, I ſay, an open and plain Diſcovery before Neighbours, of the falſhood and malice of the Slanderer in the moſt mild and Chriſtian way; or if ſuch a Diſcovery cannot be made, a Circumſpection and Care to live ſo Inoffenſively and Innocently, as no one will believe the Calumny, this will in time work all evil Surmiſes and Suſpicions out of the Minds of Men.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>And we muſt utterly renounce and forfeit the Eſteem of Men, rather than incur the Diſ-favour of God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Laſtly, we muſt utterly renounce and forfeit the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of men, rather than incur the diſ-favour of God.</note> The beſt and wiſeſt of Men are but Men ſtill, and do often judge of other Perſons, and their Proceedings, not as they ought, or as God Judgeth. Thus we ſee, <hi>When Jeſus began to ſhew unto his Diſciples, how that he muſt go up unto Jeruſalem, and ſuffer many things of the Elders, and Chief Prieſts, and Scribes, and be killed; then Peter took him up, and began to rebuke him, ſaying, Be it far from thee Lord, this ſhall not
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:151517:160"/> be unto thee,</hi> Matth. 16.21, 22. that is, he endeavour'd earneſtly to diſſwade him from ſo hazardous an Undertaking, and would have him be more careful of himſelf. And ſo it often happens to his faithful Diſciples, eſpecially his Miniſters. If any more than ordinarily Zealous of their Maſter's Glory, or faithful in his Service, ſhall attempt to Reprove a Great Man, or to oppoſe the Stream of Wickedneſs, or ſome ungodly, but prevailing Cuſtoms, his Friends, too much ſavouring of worldly Wiſdom, ſhall violently diſſwade him, not to be thus <hi>Righteous over-much,</hi> as they think.</p>
                  <p>But if it ſhall ſo happen, that in the Diſcharge of our Duty, we have not their Approbation, be they never ſo Wiſe, or eſteem'd never ſo Vertuous, having in the firſt place with all Sincerity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd what is neceſſary for us to do, we muſt vigorouſly proceed in the Diſcharge of a good Conſcience, let who will condemn us of Raſhneſs, or Imprudence.</p>
                  <p>And this is what the Apoſtle commands us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.3, 4.8. He bids us <hi>Give no offence in any thing, that the Miniſtry be not blamed;</hi> that is, he would have us make it, in the firſt place, a ſpecial part of our Care, to Abſtain ſtrictly from all things, that may give any juſt Offence, and Avert any from the Faith; endeavouring to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our ſelves to all, that all Men may look on our Behaviour in the Goſpel, with Reverence, and not with Cenſure: And ſo be attracted to a Chriſtian Life, not deter'd from it. But then he charges us withal, <hi>In all things to approve our ſelves as the Miniſters of God, in much Patience, Affliction, by Honour and Diſhonour, by evil Report, and good Report, as deceivers, and yet true;</hi> that is, he would have us approve our Fidelity in the Diſcharge of our Office by all proper Means, thro' the various Fates of being reproachfully Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome, as well as reſpectfully by others, by being Vilified, as well as Commended. So that thus at length you have ſeen, how that that part of Honour, which conſiſts in the Good Eſteem and Reputation of the wiſe and vertuous part of Mankind, tho' it is much to be valued in it ſelf, and may be lawfully Deſir'd, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably Enjoy'd, and ought carefully to be Preſerv'd: Yet there is great place for Renunciation, with reſpect both to the Attainment and Enjoyment thereof; and particularly as to the Loſs of it, that we muſt ſo far Renounce it, as not to prefer the Eſteem of Men before the Honour, that cometh from God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, And now I am to take into conſideration the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which is conferr'd, not by the wiſe and vertuous part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, nor given always upon the account of good Qualities, and worthy Performances; but the Eſteem of another ſort of Men, and for the moſt part, for quite different Qualities and Performances, viz. <hi>The Applauſes of the Vulgar, and of the Croud of Men, upon the account of what they judge Praiſe-worthy and Glorious.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>IV.</hi> How far that Honour is to be Renounc'd, which conſiſts in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes of the Vulgar, upon what they do account Praiſe-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now by the <hi>Vulgar, and the Croud of Men,</hi> I do not mean barely <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> and the lower Rank of Mankind; but alſo that mixt Multitude, or Herd of Men, as well High, as Low, Rich, as well as Poor, all of what Rank, or Degree ſoever, who have little, or no Principles of Religion, or Vertue, all whoſe Apprehenſions of Divine and Religious Matters are mean and low, and not lifted above the common Pitch, and to thoſe Heights and Improvements given us
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:151517:160"/> by true <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine.</hi> Truly all ſuch are accounted the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> and ſhall be Herded amongſt the <hi>Croud,</hi> for me, whether they be clad in Silks, or Furs, and fare Deliciouſly every day; or whether they work at the Anvil, or follow the Plow, or beg at our Doors.</p>
                  <p>And by their <hi>Applauſes,</hi> I do mean, that Vogue and Suffrage, that Approbation, and whatever other Expreſſions of good liking, which they do commonly give to bad Actions, and ſinful Practices, as Swearing, Drinking, Whoring, Fighting, Duelling, and the like. And theſe Applauſes of theirs, are as common and great a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to moſt of thoſe Sins, which are committed,<note place="margin">This ſort of Honour muſt be utterly and abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.</note> as any thing whatſoever, and muſt therefore be utterly Renounc'd, Deteſted, and Abhor'd by us.</p>
                  <p>So that if ever it ſhould ſo happen, that you ſhall unhappily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any of thoſe ſcandalous Sins (which God avert) and any of thoſe profane and unthinking Creatures, who make a Mock, a meer Jeſt of Sin, ſhall applaud you for the ſame; inſtead of being pleas'd thereat, you muſt take Shame to your ſelf, and let 'em know you are too much griev'd and troubled at your having committed ſuch Folly and Madneſs, to be pleas'd at their Recital and Plaudits given it. No ſure: A Repentance conſiſting in Sorrow and Shame is what ought to follow Sin; but to Glory in it, and to receive Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes for it, is infinitely to aggravate it. And know this for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that <hi>Except you Repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh,</hi> as many other Sinners, triumphing like Mad-men in their Impieties, have done before you, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.3.</p>
                  <p>And now Laſtly, it only remains that I lay before you, <hi>In what ſence, and how far you are bound to Renounce thoſe outward Expreſſions and Significations of Reſpect, either by Word or Deed, which are uſually given upon the Account of any of the fore-mention'd Honours.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Laſtly, in what Sence, and how far we muſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce thoſe outward Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Reſpect, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Word or Deed, which are uſually given upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any of the fore-mention'd ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</note> Hitherto we have conſider'd Honour in its internal Parts only, as Birth and Quality, Authority and Dignity, Reputation and Eſteem, either for good, or bad Qualities and Performances; and have ſhew'd you in what Sence either of theſe are to be Renounced. And now I am to do the like as to that outward part of Honour, whereby is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt and ſignify'd to the Senſes, the Eyes and Ears of Men, the Reſpect, which is born to Perſons, upon the account of any of the fore-mention'd Honours.</p>
                  <p>And as to theſe outward ſignifications of Honour, they are made either by <hi>Word,</hi> or by <hi>Deed.</hi> By Word; and they are either <hi>Divine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi> of our Veneration and Honour, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe Names and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes peculiarly belonging to God, or <hi>Humane Ones,</hi> as Titles of Honour, when we call a Perſon Lord, moſt Gracious, moſt Excellent, moſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or the like; or Titles of Reſpect, as when we call a Perſon Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Maſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alſo as to the outward ſignifications of Honour by <hi>Deed;</hi> theſe are again either Divine, as Adoration, or Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Proſtrating our ſelves on the ground before God, and ſuch other Significations of our moſt exceſſive Self-abaſement in reſpect of him, and our infinite Diſtance from him; or they are Humane, ſuch as may be alſo us'd to Men, as bowing of the Body, bending of the Knee, baring of the Head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which are Lawful, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and Dutiful ways of expreſſing our Reſpects; and are alſo
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:151517:161"/> neceſſary, according as they are apply'd to Perſons, to whom by the Laws of God, and right Reaſon they are due.</p>
                  <p>And now the Queſtion will be, In what Sence, and how far any Perſon is bound to Renounce theſe Honours and Reſpects when conferr'd upon 'em.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And,</hi> Firſt, <hi>No Created Being, either Men, or Angels, muſt ſuffer thoſe Reſpects to be given them, whether by Word, or Deed, which are proper and peculiar to ſignify our ſence of God's Majeſty and Perfections.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> No Created Being, either Men, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to be given them, whether by word, or deed which are proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify our ſence of God's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</note> Thus you'll ſee, when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had miraculouſly Heal'd <hi>A Creeple a Lyſtra, who had never walked, the people would have done Sacrifice unto them,</hi> as if they were Gods; but thoſe Good Men no ſooner perceiv'd it, but in the Abhorrency of the Blaſphemy, <hi>Rent their Garments, and ran in upon them to reſtrain them, crying out and ſaying, Sirs, Why do ye theſe things? We alſo are Men of like Paſſions with your ſelves, and preach unto you, that you ſhould turn from theſe Vanities, to ſerve the living God,</hi> Act. 14.14, 15. And no doubt, but as the Angel alſo refus'd the Worſhip which <hi>John</hi> offer'd him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.9. So both the Bleſſed Saints and Angels above, do now with the utmoſt Indignation, Renounce that Divine Worſhip given 'em by their Superſtitious Votaries, the Papiſts.</p>
                  <p>Nor muſt any Humane Creature forbear to Renounce, ſo as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the utmoſt Deteſtation and Abhorrence thereof, when any of the <hi>Divine Attributes and Perfections</hi> are aſcrib'd to 'em by the Flattery of ſinful Men; for the want of which Renunciation <hi>Herod</hi> you'll ſee, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.21, 22, 23. was the moſt ſignally puniſht by the Hand of God. <hi>It happened that upon a ſet Day</hi> Herod <hi>arrayed in Royal Apparel, ſate upon his Throne, and made an Oration unto the People; And they gave a ſhout, ſaying, It is the voice of a God, and not of a Man; and immediately the Angel of the Lord ſmote him, becauſe he gave not God the Glory, and he was eaten up of Worms, and gave up the Ghoſt;</hi> that is, becauſe he diſclaimed not that Blaſphemous Flattery of the People, God Executed that remarkable Vengeance upon him. And this ought to be a Warning to thoſe vain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate Women,<note place="margin">Women there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must with Deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce thoſe Blaſphemous Complements, wherein Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſcrib'd to them.</note> who in the Courtſhips that are paid 'em, and the Complements, which are uſually made 'em, do ſuffer even Divine Attributes and Perfections to be aſcrib'd to 'em. Nay, and theſe they receive, not only without rebuking thoſe that preſume to offer 'em, but with all the Complacence and Satisfaction in 'em. But ſurely this will be required, not only at their Hands, who do ſo Blaſphemouſly Complement 'em, but at theirs alſo, who do patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffer God to be ſo much Blaſphemed in their Praiſes; and the ſame Vengeance, which overtook <hi>Herod,</hi> will not fall ſhort of them alſo, if they Renounce and Refuſe not, with the utmoſt Deteſtation, ſuch Impiety. And it is indeed ſo common a ſtrain of Wickedneſs, that I thought it very requiſite to advertiſe you of it, and ſeriouſly to warn you againſt admitting it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Every Man muſt renounce and refuſe thoſe Titles, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, and Precedencies, which are not his due, but belong to Perſons above him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> Every man muſt renounce and refuſe thoſe Titles and Reſpects, and Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences which are not his due, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons above him.</note> A Diſtinction of Titles and Reſpects is neceſſary to keep up Order and Diſtinction of Men, and their Merits; and it is a great Diſorder and Confuſion, when Perſons either Take, or Receive ſuch, as do not belong to 'em: So that one cannot know who is
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:151517:161"/> High in Rank, or Reputation, or who is Low in the World in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of either. This is what the Wiſe-man complains of, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10.5, 6, 7. as a great Evil, and ſuch as it concerns the Magiſtrate to reſtrain by Law. <hi>There is an Evil, which I have ſeen under the Sun, as an Error, which proceedeth from the Ruler; Folly is ſet in great dignity, and the Rich ſit in low place; I have ſeen Servants upon Horſes, and Princes walking as Servants upon the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, Laſtly, So far muſt any One be from Aſſuming any thing of this Nature above him, that <hi>It becomes every Perſon out of Modeſty, Humility, and good Manners, to decline his due in this kind: And muſt ever Renounce the Entitling and Placing of himſelf, and leave it to others.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Laſtly, And muſt in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and good Manners, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline his due in this kind; and muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Entitleing of himſelf, and permit that to others.</note> This our Saviour preſcribes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>When thou art bid to a Wedding, ſit not down in the higheſt Room, leſt a more honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than thou be bidden of him; but ſit down in the loweſt Room, that when he that bade thee cometh, he may ſay unto thee, Friend go up higher: Then ſhalt thou have Worſhip in the preſence of them, who are at meat with thee.</hi> And the reaſon of this Appointment of our Saviour's, in ſo ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly trivial a Caſe, was not only to pull down our Ambition and Pride, but to promote Courteſy, and Civility, and good Manners, which are very conſiderable Vertues in Society, and therefore to be ſure of good account in Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>But the Contrary to both theſe laſt Inſtances, of Renouncing out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Reſpects and Honours, is one of the great <hi>Vanities of the World,</hi> which ſhall be more fully ſpoke to under another Head. But yet I muſt not diſmiſs this without anſwering an Objection, or Two.</p>
                  <p>It is uſual amongſt other Titles of Princes,<note place="margin">Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Titles of Honour, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> to aſcribe to 'em the Attributes of <hi>moſt Gracious, moſt Religious, moſt Excellent,</hi> and the like; which may ſeem to ſavour too much of that Flattery, for admitting of which <hi>Herod</hi> was Puniſht: And the Abſurdity ſeems to be the greater, if thoſe Princes happen to be Vicious and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly. But here it is to be conſider'd, that Princes, and great Magiſtrates, as they are in an Exalted Condition above the reſt of Men; ſo thoſe Titles muſt be given 'em, which ſhall raiſe and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a due Veneration towards them, and their Office. And even when the Perſons Inveſted with thoſe Dignities happen to be Cruel and Wicked; yet ſuch Titles, as moſt Gracious, moſt Religious, are not un-befitting their Office, tho' they may not ſo well ſuit their Perſonal Character; and it is upon the account of that, that they are given 'em: As it was upon the Score of his Office, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſtyl'd <hi>Feſtus,</hi> a Heathen Magiſtrate, <hi>moſt Noble,</hi> Act. 26.25.</p>
                  <p>Next it is urged againſt Receiving Titles of Reſpect, thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>Be ye not called Maſters, for one is your Maſter, even Chriſt,</hi> Matth. 23.10. But in order to clear this, you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that this is an Hebrew Idiom, or manner of Expreſſing, in which Calling and Being, are all one, as <hi>They ſhall call his Name Emanuel,</hi> ſignifies, <hi>he ſhall be Emanuel, or God with us.</hi> So here, <hi>Be ye not called Maſters,</hi> is a forbidding of Men to be Maſters one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. And in what Sence is this to be underſtood? Why, amongſt the Jews, you muſt know, thoſe who took upon 'em to be Leaders and Teachers, did challenge a blind Obedience from their Diſciples and Followers, and requir'd 'em to give up their Faith, to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:151517:162"/> ſway'd by 'em: But our Saviour would have no meer Man pretend to be ſo much a Maſter over Men's Faith, as if he were Infallible; in which Sence to be a Maſter, was our Saviour's Right. But otherwiſe, the Title of Maſter, as it ſignifies no more than a Humane Reſpect, is no more to be refus'd, than that of Father: Which yet, as amongſt the Jews it was uſed to mean ſuch a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of the School of the Prophets, as no Man ought to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, was alſo forbid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.9.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, It is objected againſt Perſons of Quality being Placed or Seated higher than others in Religious Aſſemblies, from thoſe words of St. <hi>James,</hi> 2.2, 3, 4. <hi>If there come into your Aſſembly a man with a gold Ring, in goodly Apparel, and there come alſo a poor man, in vile Raiment; and ye have reſpect unto him that weareth the gay Clothing, and ſay unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and ſay to the poor, Stand thou there, or ſit under my footſtool, Are ye not then partial in your ſelves, and become Judges of evil Thoughts?</hi> But this Objection will be taken off, and this difficult Place clear'd, if you conſider what is here meant by <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> and upon what account <hi>Reſpect of Perſons is forbid to be had to any one in them.</hi> Now by <hi>Aſſembly</hi> is here to be underſtood a Court of Judicature, where Law-ſuits are tryed, for ſo not only the word tranſlated, <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> does elſewhere, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.17. ſignify; but there are ſeveral Expreſſions in this place, which do determine it here to this Sence; as particularly when thoſe, that order'd the Rich to ſit in a more Honourable Place, and the Poor in a leſs Honourable, are ſaid to have a <hi>Footſtool,</hi> which did belong to Tribunals; and to be Judges of evil Thoughts, that is, Partial in their Judgments, Men that thought more of the Perſons, than their Cauſes.</p>
                  <p>And the reaſon why that ſort of Reſpect of Perſons in their ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Aſſemblies, the Placing of the Man of Quality in a higher, the Poorer in a lower Place, which ſeems not to have been ſo material, was notwithſtanding forbid; was becauſe this would have been lookt upon, according to the then Apprehenſions of the Jews, as a Token of Partiality in the Judge: For as the Learned <hi>Hammond</hi> upon the Place does obſerve, It was provided by a Canon of the Jews, that when a Rich Man, and a Poor have a Suit together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Conſiſtories, either both muſt ſit, or both ſtand in the ſame Rank, to avoid all marks of Partiality. So that this place forbids not Precedency and Place to be given, or taken, by Perſons that are in Quality, or Authority, above others, either in Church-Aſſemblies, or in other Meetings; but only in the Judicial Meetings of thoſe times, and not then, but becauſe that in the then Apprehenſions of Men, ſuch Precedency would ſignify Partiality in the Judge, that ſuffer'd it. So that it remains, that <hi>Titles of Honour, Reſpects and Precedency</hi> may be receiv'd, when duly given. And I thought it requiſite to take off theſe Objections, both to clear theſe miſtaken Places of Scripture, and that you might not refuſe <hi>To pay Honour to whom Honour is due,</hi> which is a Duty upon all Men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.7. And which a fooliſh Sect amongſt us do deny, chiefly grounding the Rudeneſs of their Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour towards their Betters, upon the now mention'd places of Scripture, which they wreſt, as they do the other, to their own Deſtruction. Thus much upon this Occaſion.</p>

                     <hi>THE Sixteenth Lecture.</hi> Firſt, That I ſhould Renounce the Devil, and all his Works; the Pomps and Vanity of this wicked World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh.</head>
                  <p>HAving undertook to give you a particular and diſtinct account, not only of thoſe Temptations, which ariſe from the <hi>World</hi> in general, but alſo from all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar things, whether Good, or Evil, therein contain'd: And having already ſurvey'd the <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Honours</hi> thereof, and diſtinctly ſhew'd you in what Sence, and how far you are to <hi>Renounce</hi> each of them, and every Particular included in them. I come now to conſider,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Pleaſures thereof, and to ſhew you in what Sence,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What's meant by the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this World, in what Sence, and how far they are to be Renounced.</note> 
                     <hi>and how far you are alſo to Renounce the Pleaſures of this World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now all Pleaſure, of what Kind ſoever it be, does ariſe from the <hi>Agreeableneſs</hi> of the Object with ſome Faculty that can perceive it. And therefore <hi>Pleaſure</hi> in general, <hi>Is that Satisfaction and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, which any part of our Nature perceives, when its Appetites are gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd with what it deſires.</hi> And as both Soul and Body have their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perceptive Faculties and Appetites; ſo the Gratification and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, which is given to both, do cauſe different kinds of Pleaſure. And accordingly they may all of 'em, I do think, be reduc'd to theſe Four, <hi>Rational, Senſitive, Senſual, and Recreative Pleaſures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And,</hi> Firſt, <hi>As to Rational Pleaſure:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> Rational Pleaſure is very Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable.</note> 
                     <hi>This is that noble Satisfaction and ſweet Delight, which the Soul perceives, when it finds it ſelf Improve in Knowledge, or in Vertue; or when it reflects upon the Good it has done.</hi> As to Knowledge, the moſt delicious Dainties are not ſo truly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to the Bodily Appetite, as real and uſeful Knowledge is to the Rational; nor is Light more grateful to the Eye, than Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is to the Underſtanding. And all uſeful Knowledge, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Divine, ought to be ſought after with all the Study and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry poſſible, and we cannot too much indulge the Appetite, which craves it: Inſomuch that St. <hi>Paul did not ceaſe to pray for the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians, and to deſire that they might be filled with the Knowledge of God's will, in all wiſdom and ſpiritual underſtanding,</hi> Col. 1.9. And to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in Vertue, to get the victory over of our Paſſions, to ſubdue our Appetites, and the like, yields ſo great and pure a Satisfaction, that Happineſs it ſelf is defin'd to be that <hi>Pleaſure, which the Mind takes in from a ſence of Vertue, and a conſcience of Well-doing; and of conforming all things to the Rules of both.</hi> And then as to that ſence
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:151517:163"/> of Joy and Comfort, which Vertuous and Heavenly Minds do feel in doing Good; this is exceedingly more Excellent and Exalted, than all worldly and wicked Pleaſures, as is exemplify'd in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, who counted it <hi>His meat and drink to do the Will of him that ſent him, and to finiſh his work,</hi> Joh. 4.34. which was <hi>To go about doing Good,</hi> Act. 10.28. So excellent a thing is Rational Pleaſure, and ſo much it is our Duty, as well as Intereſt, to gratify our ſelves therewith. But yet as Excellent and Heavenly a Pleaſure as this is, there is room for <hi>Renunciation,</hi> even with reſpect to this. And,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">But Firſt, no Man muſt make meer Pleaſure the End of his Knowledge.</note>Firſt, <hi>No Man muſt make the end of his Knowledge to be the meer Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Knowing,</hi> that is, we muſt not ſeek after Knowledge, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Knowledge ſake, and not for the Uſe and Inſtruction of our ſelves and others. The true End of Knowledge is to direct our ſelves and others thereby to Happineſs, both in this, and the other World. And indeed ſuch a Greedineſs, as is ſeen in ſome Men, of ſwallowing up all ſorts of Learning, and not letting others to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it, and to be Benefited by it, is but a better ſort of Senſuality and Voluptuouſneſs, and ought therefore to be Renounced by every Chriſtian. The greateſt Goods are ever common: They were deſign'd by God to be ſo, and by good Chriſtians they are made ſo. And Knowledge then being a principal <hi>Good,</hi> every good Man is free in Communicating of that, and of Edifying others therewith; and therefore it is requir'd of a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> whoſe Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is ſuppos'd to exceed other Men's, that <hi>He be apt to teach,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Nor Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, muſt that Satisfaction and Delight, which ariſes from the ſence and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of good and worthy Deeds, be ſo much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are admir'd and applauded for it, as becauſe they are really in themſelves Vertuous.</note>Secondly, And as to that Pleaſure, which ariſes from the Sence and Conſcience of good and worthy Deeds, as much as we may be permitted to reliſh and enjoy it, yet we muſt take care, that our Satisfaction and Delight be more, becauſe we are really Vertuous, and that we do Good, than that we be admir'd and applauded for it; for <hi>We muſt take heed that we do not our Alms,</hi> or whatever other Good, <hi>before men to be ſeen of them; otherwiſe we have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of our Father which is in Heaven,</hi> Matth. 6.1. But to proceed,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a <hi>Senſitive Pleaſure, and that is when the Animal Life, or the Bodily Senſes are gratify'd with thoſe Objects, which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to 'em. All Pleaſure,</hi> as was ſaid, <hi>ariſes from the ſuitableneſs and agreeableneſs between the perceptive Faculties, and the Objects that affect them.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> Senſitive Pleaſure, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> reſults from the ſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs between the perceptive Faculties, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect them, is lawful.</note> And our Bountiful Maker, as he has given the Animal Life many perceptive Faculties, the Senſes of Seeing, Hearing, Smelling, Taſting, and Feeling; ſo he has provided ſuitable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for all thoſe ſeveral Faculties, and does allow us to gratify our ſelves therewith: <hi>For it is good and comely for one to Eat and to Drink, and to enjoy the Good of all his labour that he taketh under the Sun, all the days of his Life which God giveth him; for it is his portion,</hi> Eccl. 5.18. Nay, it is very neceſſary, that we ſhould take Pleaſure in gratifying the ſenſible Cravings of our Nature, for if our Palates do not reliſh our Meat, or if our Stomachs refuſe it, we ſhould ſtarve. And indeed the Comforts and Enjoyments of this Life, which we receive from the bountiful Hand of God, is a great Subject of our Praiſes and Thankſgivings to him. <hi>Thou prepareſt a Table for me in the preſence of mine Enemies; thou anointeſt my Head with
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:151517:163"/> Oyl, my Cup runneth over,</hi> ſaid Holy <hi>David,</hi> in a great ſence of God's bountiful Goodneſs towards him, in beſtowing upon him ſo many worldly Comforts. Thus theſe Senſitive Pleaſures may be lawfully Enjoy'd by us, and they are only then, and ſo far to be Renounc'd, when they become,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Senſual,</hi> which when they do,<note place="margin">Theſe Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful only when they become, Thirdly, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual.</note> they are indeed the greateſt Temptations the World has to draw us into Sin; and many Thouſands there are, whom when nothing elſe could Corrupt, have been miſerably foil'd by the Power of ſenſual Pleaſures: Which what they are, and how far to be Renounc'd, I come now to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto you.</p>
                  <p>And it is then, that theſe <hi>Senſitive Pleaſures,</hi> which otherwiſe would be for the Preſervation and Comfort of our Nature, and the Matter of our Praiſes to God: It is then, I ſay, that they become <hi>Senſual,</hi> and ſo are to be Renounced, when they gratify only our corrupt and depraved Natures. As the ſenſitive Nature craves ſuch things as are ſuitable to it, and are neceſſary to its Preſervation and Comfort in this Life; and ſenſitive Pleaſures are ſuch as ariſe from ſuch allowable Gratifications: So the <hi>Senſual</hi> and Corrupted Nature of Man craves theſe ſenſitive Pleaſures beyond Bounds and Moderation: It prefers 'em before Rational and Divine Pleaſures. It appears to reliſh no Enjoyments like thoſe of Senſe; it gluts it ſelf with ſenſitive Pleaſures, ſo as to ſurfeit on theſe Sweets. Nay, and laſtly, the <hi>Senſual Man</hi> does load and burthen his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture therewith, ſo as to render it unfit for the Duties of his Calling and Religion. Theſe are the inordinate Cravings of the ſenſual Nature; and when we gratify this corrupted Nature of ours, to this immoderate Degree, with <hi>Senſitive Pleaſures;</hi> then thoſe Pleaſures which were in themſelves allowable, become <hi>Senſual,</hi> and ſuch as muſt be utterly Renounced by every Chriſtian. And as we will accordingly Renounce <hi>Senſual Pleaſures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>We muſt not prefer Senſitive Ones in our Judgments, or Deſires, either before our ſpiritual Joy in God, or the eternal Joys of his Kingdom;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">As, Firſt, when we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer 'em in our Judgments or Deſires, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before our ſpiritual Joy in God, or the eternal Joys of his Kingdom.</note> which is what the Carnal Man does do; <hi>Which is,</hi> I ſay, <hi>what the Carnal Man does do:</hi> 
                     <q>For while the Fleſh is the prevailing Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in any Man, he only reliſhes the ſatisfaction of the Senſes: He cannot enjoy God, he cannot delight in doing his Will, no more than a Swine can in clean Paſture, whoſe natural Property inclines him only to wallow in the Mire. But when the Soul is clarify'd and purg'd by the great Refiner, how ſublime and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a Pleaſure does it feel in the Love of God, and in his Service! As in natural Feeding, when the Palate is in due Temper, our Taſt commends our proper Food to the Appetite, and the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to the Stomach; but a foul Stomach diſ-affects the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, ſpoils the Palate, and the moſt ſavoury and wholeſom Meat is loathſom, when the Diſeaſe is the <hi>Taſter.</hi> Thus if the Soul be in its due Temper, the <hi>Doing the will of God would be our Meat and Drink,</hi> mixt with a ſweeter Pleaſure than thoſe natural Operations are; but the Soul in the unregenerate Man is ſo Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and Carnaliz'd, that it has no taſt of the pure Delights of Bleſſed Spirits in Communion with God: Like the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who deſpis'd the Bread of Angels, and impatiently long'd for the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:151517:164"/> Onions and Garlick, and Fleſh-Pots of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                     </q> But this muſt not be our Temper, but with the Holy Pſalmiſt, we muſt be able ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally to ſay; <hi>The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever; the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether; more to be deſired are they than Gold, yea than much fine Gold, ſweeter alſo than Honey, and the Honey-comb,</hi> Pſal. 19.9, 10.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, And we muſt Renounce it as a great ſign of a ſenſual Spirit, which reliſhes no Enjoyments like thoſe of Sence,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> When a Man reliſhes no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments like thoſe of ſence.</note> 
                     <hi>When a Perſon is obſerv'd to be wholly in a manner purveying for the Belly,</hi> Cook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Ordering his Diſhes, always commending, or rather quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling with every thing he eats or drinks: No, the Diſcourſes of Philoſophical, wiſe, and vertuous Minds, is even at the very Table of other-gueſs Matters, than of the Excellency of that Diſh, the Poynancy of ſuch a Sauce, or the Flavour of ſuch and ſuch Liquors. And with theſe Epicures we may juſtly Expoſtulate in the words of our Saviour: <hi>Are ye yet without underſtanding? Do ye not yet underſtand that whatever entereth into the mouth goeth into the belly, and is caſt out into the Draught,</hi> Matth. 15.17. And it is ſure a ſign of an Underſtanding below the Excellency of the Soul of Man, to concern it ſelf ſo much about what in few Hours will go down into the Guts, the Sink, and the vileſt part of the Body.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>It muſt be Renounced as a high and ſinful Senſuality to glut our Senſes, ſo as to ſurfeit on theſe Sweets.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>III.</hi> When he gluts himſelf, ſo as to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit on theſe Sweets.</note> There is nothing which does more decay Nature, which brings upon us more deſperate and incurable Diſeaſes, and does more precipitate and haſten a ſudden Death, than Exceſs in the Gratifications of Men's Luſts and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites. But this is groſly to abuſe the Creatures of God, which were allow'd us only for our Uſe; It is to make but an ungrateful Return to him, for all his Bounties: And is unnaturally to deſtroy our ſelves for the ſake of a paultry Pleaſure, which vaniſheth in the very Enjoyment; of a Pleaſure, which is mixed with more bitter Ingredients than Gall and Wormwood: <hi>For even in their Laughter the heart of thoſe ſenſual Men is ſorrowful, and the end of their mirth is heavineſs,</hi> Prov. 14.13.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>The Deliciouſneſs of thoſe Pleaſures muſt not cauſe any one to load and burthen his Nature therewith, to that Degree, as to render him unfit for the Duties of his Calling and Religion;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">And laſtly, when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſneſs of theſe Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures cauſes him to load and burthen his Nature therewith, ſo as to render him unfit for the Duties of his Calling, and Religion.</note> in which reſpect thoſe do Offend, who do ſo immoderately indulge the Appetites in Eating and Drinking, that they are drowſy and ſleepy even under the Meſſages ſent them from the King of Heaven, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd them by his Ambaſſadors, the Preachers of his Word. No, the End of all Pleaſure, as well as of <hi>Recreations,</hi> is to render us not leſs, but more vigorous and lively in the Service of God, and the proper Buſineſs of our Calling: Which brings me,</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>To conſider Recreative Pleaſures, and to ſhew you what they are, in what Sence, and how far we are to Renounce thoſe ſort of Pleaſures.</hi> Now theſe are meerly of a middle, and of an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Nature.<note place="margin">Recreative Pleaſures of a middle and indifferent Nature.</note> They are neither wholly Mental, nor altogether Bodily Pleaſures, but may be either. And they are neither neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily Good, nor Evil, but either one, or other, according as they are uſed: For when the Mind has been long intent upon Study and Meditation, it may be very convenient to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbend</hi> it, by giving
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:151517:164"/> our ſelves ſome Bodily Diverſion, as Walking, Riding, or other innocent Recreation. And when the Body has been long fatigued and wearied with Labour, it is requiſite to give it Eaſe; and it is no wiſe hurtful, either to Soul or Body, to fall into a chearful, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be an innocent Converſation. And indeed the moderate uſe of innocent Pleaſures and Recreations is both uſeful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. It enlivens Nature, brisks up our Spirits, and renders us more able to ſet again about ſerious Buſineſs and Employment. For to intermix no Gratifications, nor Diverſions with our more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Affairs, makes the Mind unactive, dull, and uſeleſs.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Recreations,</hi> the moſt innocent of 'em, are to be <hi>moderately</hi> and <hi>ſparingly</hi> us'd by every Chriſtian;<note place="margin">The moſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are to be ſparingly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> for he that ſhall much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge himſelf in the allow'd Pleaſures of the World, ſhall quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring himſelf into a Frame of Spirit, that will not eaſily endure Patience, Self-denial, and Mortification, and other the more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and conſiderable Parts of Religion. Eaſe and Diverſions ſoften the Sinews, diſſolve the Nerves, and are apt to render us Nice, and Delicate, and Effeminate, a Temper the moſt unſuitable for any Souldier, becauſe it will utterly indiſpoſe him for Military Severities. Eaſe and Pleaſure therefore muſt be warily Indulg'd to, by the Souldier of JESUS, in whoſe Warfare there are both Conflicts and Severities, far ſurpaſſing the hardeſt, which other Wars engage us in.</p>
                  <p>No, If you will become Excellent in Religion, nay, keep but within the Bounds of Innocence, you muſt innure your ſelves much to Chriſtian Severity and Reſervedneſs; and the moſt harmleſs of this World's Delights are to be more rarely us'd, than is commonly thought of. He that conſtantly eats a full Meal, will not endure a Day of Faſting; and he that does not ſometimes deny himſelf in lawful Enjoyments, will be hardly able to Reſiſt a Temptation to immoderate Gratifications. But however, no Man ſhould make Sports his Buſineſs, nor Paſtimes his Employment, no more than Cordials his Drink, nor Sauces his Meat. <hi>To every thing there is a ſeaſon, and a time to every purpoſe under Heaven; there is a time to weep, as well as a time to laugh; a time to mourn, as well as a time to dance,</hi> Eccl. 3.1.4. And therefore ſuch, who think they have nothing elſe to do with their Time, muſt conſider, that they have that precious Talent given 'em to greater Ends, than to waſt it in Divertiſments.</p>
                  <p>Nay, and thoſe whoſe ample Fortunes in the World put them above the common Condition of Mankind, and are not to eat of their Bread in the ſweat of their Brows, need not live by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and a Calling, would do well to conſider, that the greateſt part of their Time ought to be laid out in doing Good in the World; in being Uſeful and Beneficial to the Society whereof they are Parts and Members. In enquiring into the Neceſſities of their poorer Brethren; in contriving Ways and Means, both to Employ and Relieve 'em. And above all, in promoting Religion, and the Honour of God amongſt Men, ſo far at leaſt, as their own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Power reaches, whether in their Families, or amongſt their Tenants, Neighbours and Dependants. And theſe are Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, which will yield both Satisfaction here, and will be
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:151517:165"/> rewarded with eternal Joys hereafter. Theſe are Employments and Pleaſures both, and (which Pleaſures ſeldom do) will turn to good Account hereafter. And thus I have at length finiſht all that I think neceſſary to ſay to you, concerning Renouncing either the <hi>World</hi> in general, or thoſe particular <hi>Good things,</hi> into which it is divided, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Riches, Honours,</hi> and the <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of it. There was great variety of uſeful Matter to be conſider'd under theſe ſeveral Heads, and therefore I have been the longer upon 'em: I ſhall be more ſhort upon the reſt. The next of which are,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The <hi>Evils</hi> of the World, viz. <hi>Poverty, Diſgrace,</hi> and <hi>Afflictions:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Evils of the World, are Poverty, Diſgrace, &amp; Affliction.</note> Theſe are oppoſite to the other <hi>Goods,</hi> and they are Inſtruments, whereby Satan, our great Adverſary, does attack us, when the other fail him, as is eminently ſeen in the Caſe of <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>But theſe are not ſo ſucceſsful to Ruine us, as thoſe, which are call'd the <hi>Good things</hi> of the World, commonly are. There is leſs Variety in the ways wherein theſe do tempt us. And we do not open the Gates of our Souls to theſe, as we do to the Enjoyments of this World: But do rather fortify our ſelves againſt them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there are Temptations in theſe alſo, and I will conſider 'em as briefly as I can, and how they are to be Reſiſted by us. To proceed then,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As to <hi>Poverty</hi> and <hi>Afflictions;</hi> (for I ſhall not conſider theſe Two altogether apart, the Temptations that either give us, being much the ſame) Theſe indeed inſtead of Temptations to Sin, and Hindrances to Vertue, do very often prove Mortifiers of Vice, and the great occaſions of a Holy Life.<note place="margin">Poverty and Afflictions, inſtead of Temptations to Sin, and Hindrances to Vertue, do very often prove Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiers of Vice, and the great occaſions of a holy Life.</note> For beſides that in a State of Adverſity and Want, we are not ſo ſubject to Pride, Inſolence, and a Contempt of Religion; nor ſo liable to Luxury, Ambition, and Covetouſneſs, and many other Sins, which are too often the Effects of a proſperous and flouriſhing Condition: The divers ſorts of Afflictions and Adverſities, as Sickneſs, Loſs of Goods, and of Friends, Poverty and Want, and the like, are naturally Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and do mightily tend to the Encreaſe of many the moſt precious Graces in the ſight of God, as might be eaſily made appear. Theſe wean us from the World, and inſtead of <hi>Setting our affections on things below,</hi> they do cauſe us to <hi>put our affections on things above.</hi> Seeing the Vanity, Emptineſs, Tranſitorineſs, and great Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of this World's Enjoyments, we are apt to thirſt after thoſe Permanent, Certain, and Everlaſting Joys, prepared in Heaven for us. When Afflictions, and Want, and all other Hopes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations fail us, we do then uſually betake our ſelves to God, for Comfort and Support. And thus drawing nigh unto God we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come acquainted with him, and he then vouchſafes us ſome Taſts of ſpiritual Delights and Pleaſures. And then having Experienc'd the ineffable Satisfactions, communicated to Pious and Humble Souls in their Devotions, and Religious Exerciſes, we become Heavenly-Minded, weary of this World, <hi>And deſirous to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt, which is beſt of all.</hi> Thus, I ſay, Afflictions and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, are many times, next under God's Grace, great Helps to Piety and Devotion.</p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:151517:165"/>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs they are alſo very often great Temptations to many Sins and Impieties,<note place="margin">Nevertheleſs they are often great Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to many Sins &amp; Impieties.</note> and as ſuch Satan does uſe 'em. They are apt to breed in us Impatience and Diſcontent, and Envy at the outward Felicity of the Wicked. And Poverty in particular, when it meets with Minds ill-diſpos'd, and not ſeaſon'd with Principles of Vertue and Honeſty, Tempts 'em to Fraud and Theft. And generally when Perſons labour under Neceſſities and Wants, they think they have enough to do to provide Neceſſaries for Themſelves and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; that they may therefore diſpenſe with the Exerciſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and that it is enough for the Rich Ones to frequent the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip and Sacraments. But in the</p>
                  <p>Firſt Place, it behoves ſuch, who labour under Poverty, or any Kind of Affliction, to beware they be not Tempted to Impatience and Diſcontent.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> It behoves thoſe, who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under Poverty, or any kind of Affliction, to beware of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience and Diſcontent.</note> And there is little Reaſon we ſhould be Tempted thereby into theſe Sins; for, in good Truth, theſe Kind of Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in moſt Men's Caſes, are Tokens of God's Fatherly Love and Kindneſs, and of his Ordering all things for our Good. So the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6. <hi>Whom the Lord loveth he chaſteneth, and ſcourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every Son whom he receiveth.</hi> This is as great a Paradox to Fleſh and Blood, as it is to a Child to be under the Diſcipline of the Rod and Ferula; to either of which, <hi>No Chaſtening for the preſent ſeemeth to be Joyous, but Grievous: Nevertheleſs afterwards it yieldeth the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Fruit of Righteouſneſs to them, which are exerciſed thereby,</hi> ver. 11. Theſe afflicting Providences tend to mortify our Vanity, and to take of our Confidences in worldly Things, which the Soul of Man in Affluence and Abundance is extreamly ſubject to, and than which there is ſcarcely a more ſinful Temper of Mind: Such Reaſon had <hi>David</hi> Thankfully to Acknowledge God's Goodneſs in 'em: <hi>I know O Lord, that thy Judgments are right, and that thou in Faithfulneſs haſt afflicted me,</hi> Pſal. 119.75. And <hi>ver.</hi> 67. he profeſſes, <hi>That before he was afflicted he went aſtray; but now,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I have kept thy word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Thoſe in the worſt of Circumſtances, muſt not Envy the outward Felicity of the Wicked.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> Thoſe, in the worſt of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, muſt not envy the outward Felicity of the Wicked.</note> The Pſalmiſt declares, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 73.2, 3.5. <hi>That his Feet had almoſt gone, and that his Steps had well nigh ſlipt,</hi> upon this occaſion; <hi>For I was Envious,</hi> ſays he, <hi>at the Fooliſh, when I ſaw the Proſperity of the Wicked, that they were not in Trouble,</hi> neither <hi>were they Plagued like other Men.</hi> But what was the Conſequence of this their Proſperity, and Freedom from Afflictions? Why that <hi>Pride compaſſed them as a Chain, and that Violence cover'd them as a Garment; they ſet their Mouth againſt the Heavens, and their Tongue walked through the Earth;</hi> that is, they became horridly Wicked and Profane upon it, <hi>ver.</hi> 6.9. And are theſe Men to be Envy'd then? No, <hi>Go into the Sanctuary,</hi> as this Pſalmiſt did, that is, conſult Religion, <hi>and you will underſtand their End, that ſurely they are ſet in ſlippery Places; and that God will caſt them down into Deſtruction,</hi> ver. 17, 18. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fret not thy ſelf, becauſe of Evil-doers, neither be thou Envious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the workers of Iniquity,</hi> Pſal. 37.1.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In caſe of Poverty in particular, <hi>You muſt be infinitely careful, leaſt to reſcue your ſelf out of it, you be Tempted to Fraud, and eſpecially to Stealing and Purloyning.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>III.</hi> A Perſon that is Poor, muſt be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely careful leaſt to Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue himſelf out of it, he be tempted to Fraud, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyning.</note> Poverty is indeed an Evil in it ſelf, and it may be Avoided by us, provided it be by lawful Means.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:151517:166"/> And it is a Man's Duty indeed, by all honeſt ways, to reſcue himſelf out of ſuch an ill Condition; as by Labour and Induſtry in an honeſt Calling, to Relieve One from Want, and Cold, and Nakedneſs; and to ſuffer any Hardſhips, rather than to run into Debt, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Impriſonment. But however, whatever Diſtreſſes you ſhall fall into, you muſt Reſolve with <hi>Job</hi> thus, 27.2, 3.6, 7. <hi>As God liveth, who hath taken away my Judgment, and the Almighty, who hath vexed my Soul; All the while my Breath is in me, and the Spirit of God is in my Noſtrils, I will not remove my Integrity from me; My Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I will hold faſt, and will not let it go; my Heart ſhall not Reproach me ſo long as I live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Nor muſt any think, that becauſe they are Poor, they are e're the more diſengag'd from the Service of God, and their Attendance upon him in all the Parts of Divine Worſhip,</hi>

But rather, becauſe of their Poverty, they may be expected, in reaſon, to be more Frequent, and more Devout in Holy Exerciſes; for the leſs they have of outward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, the more reaſon they have to provide themſelves of Spiritual Conſolations, that they may not be Miſerable in both Worlds: And ſince this World Frowns upon 'em, to ſecure to themſelves thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more Valuable Treaſures in Heaven, to which the meaneſt <hi>Cottager</hi> ſtands as fair a <hi>Candidate,</hi> as the greateſt <hi>Nobleman.</hi> And, indeed, ſuch is the Regard our Saviour has to 'em, that he made it a peculiar Mark of his being the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> that <hi>The Poor had the Goſpel Preached unto them,</hi> Matth. 11.5.

                     <note place="margin">In what ſence, and how far we muſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and the Temptations it gives us.</note>The Laſt of the World's Evils is <hi>Diſgrace,</hi> and this is Oppoſite to the Honours of it. Now <hi>Diſgrace</hi> is a thing, which Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is extreamly ſenſible of: And if it be generally a matter of Diſgrace, to profeſs true and ſerious Religion, it is wonderful how Men will ſhrink from it, who in their own Minds have ſtrong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of it, and good Affections towards it. It was the Fear of this <hi>Diſgrace,</hi> which made <hi>Nicodemus come to our Saviour by Night, Joh.</hi> 7.50. And tho' <hi>Many of the chief Rulers alſo Believed on him, yet, becauſe of the Phariſees, they did not confeſs him, leſt they ſhould be put out of the Synagogue, for they loved the Praiſe of Men, more than the Praiſe of God,</hi> Joh. 12.42, 43. that is, They valued their Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with Men, and their Places and Poſts of Honour, more than the Teſtimony of, and Reputation with, God himſelf.</p>
                  <p>But as the True Religion is here openly Profeſt amongſt us; and generally it receives no Diſgrace heartily to Eſpouſe it, and to Live up to it; but is indeed a matter of Diſgrace to do the contrary, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be with ſome profligate Debauchees of our Age: If it happen that you ſhould Fall into their Company and Acquaintance (which God preſerve you from:) So the Temptations of this Nature, which they will give you, to cool you towards the ſerious Profeſſion, and Practice of Religion, will be Conſider'd hereafter, when I come to ſpeak of the <hi>wicked World,</hi> and the Temptations, which Ariſe from thence:</p>
                  <p>And thus I have conſider'd, and laid before you, as the <hi>World</hi> in General, and the <hi>Good Things</hi> thereof in Particular, viz. <hi>Riches, Honours,</hi> and <hi>Pleaſures:</hi> So on the contrary, the Oppoſite Evils of it,

                  <p>Laſtly, That I do the like, concerning ſome Things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of a middle Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Callings, Conditions of Life,</hi> and the <hi>Cares of this World,</hi> which are the <hi>Appurtenances</hi> of it, and afford great matter of Temptation and Tryal to us therein: And in what Sence, and how far you are alſo to Renounce each of theſe, I will endeavour to ſhew you.</p>
                  <p>And, Firſt, Let us conſider the <hi>Callings of the World,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

Now a Calling is ſome ſettled Courſe of Life, wherein a Perſon employs himſelf in ſome Buſineſs, ſuch as Providence has fitted him with Abilities for, and which he is Called and Appointed unto, to employ himſelf therein to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, and to his own, and the publick Good. And there is no Man, nor Woman, if not utterly diſabled in Body and Mind, who ought not to be of ſome ſuch Calling: That is,</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, every Man ought in a ſettled Courſe of Life to betake himſelf to ſome Buſineſs.<note place="margin">Every Man is to betake himſelf to ſome Buſineſs.</note> 
                     <hi>Adam,</hi> even in the State of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence was Enjoyn'd to <hi>Dreſs and keep the Garden,</hi> or e're he could <hi>Freely eat of every Tree thereof,</hi> Gen. 2.15, 16. And ſince his Fall, it is as well the Duty, as it is the Curſe of all his Poſterity, that <hi>In the ſweat of our Brows we muſt eat of our Bread,</hi> Gen. 3.19. So that every Child of <hi>Adam</hi> muſt now with great Induſtry and Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation Employ himſelf, in order to obtain the Neceſſaries or Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies of this Life. It was indeed from the very Beginning, and even in Paradiſe it ſelf, our Duty to be Employ'd; but it is now both our Duty and Puniſhment, that we muſt Employ our ſelves, even to the taking of Pains, every Man in his proper Calling.</p>
                  <p>And that Calling, which every Man is to Employ his Time in, muſt be ſuch, as Providence has fitted him with Abilities for,<note place="margin">It muſt be ſuch as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has fitted him with Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>And to whatſoever particular Calling any Man's peculiar Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties do fit him, to that he is to look upon himſelf,<note place="margin">And ſuch he is prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively Called and appointed to by God, with due A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities.</note> as preparatively <hi>Call'd,</hi> or Appointed by God; and lawful Authority in Church, or State is to determine his Call.

And to ſome he gives the whole <hi>Ten Talents</hi> to Trade withal to their Maſter's Uſe, that is, Authority, Riches, Learning, Skill in Buſineſs, and Strength of Body and Mind; and accordingly of all he will require an Account

And alſo, as every Man is a Member of the Body Politick, he is bound to employ his Time, and Parts, and Pains for its Welfare; for God requires, that <hi>As every Man has received the Gift, that accordingly they ſhould miniſter the ſame one to another, as good Stewards of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Grace of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.10. And no Member of Church, or State, of what Rank or Quality ſoever he be, but muſt Employ, or Intereſt himſelf for the Publick Good; <hi>For God hath ſo tempered the Body,</hi> or Humane Societies, <hi>together, that the Members ſhould have the ſame care one of another; and whether one Member ſuffers, he would have all the Members ſuffer with it,</hi> as in the Natural Body; <hi>or one Member be Honoured, he would have all the Members rejoice with it.</hi> 1 Cor. 12.24, 25, 26.

                  <p>And now the Queſtion will be, What is to be Renounced, with reſpect to the Callings of this World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And,</hi> Firſt, <hi>It behoves all Perſons utterly to Renounce ſuch Callings and Profeſſions of Men in the World, as are directly ſinful and wicked:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> All Perſons muſt renounce ſuch Callings and Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly ſinful and wicked.</note> Such are Bawds, Pimps, Juglers, Conjurers, and the like Impious ways of living, whereby ſome Wretches do ſo notoriouſly Miniſter to the Devil's Kingdom, and ſo directly promote the Ruine of Souls, that to Name 'em, is to Condemn 'em; and there need be no more ſaid to render 'em odious to all thoſe, who have any the leaſt degrees of vertuous Principles remaining in their Souls. I ſhall only tell you, that the Guilt contracted by theſe is ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Great, and a ſufficient Repentance for Crimes ſo very Black, ſo near to impoſſible, that you muſt ſo far Renounce 'em, as to Deteſt the very Thoughts of Embarking your ſelves ever in theſe, or any other <hi>Callings,</hi> whereby Sin is immediately and neceſſarily ſerv'd, and the Damnation of thoſe <hi>Souls, for whom Chriſt Died,</hi> ſo directly procur'd.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It concerns all Perſons to Renounce all ſuch Callings, as tend to the Hurt, not the Good of the Publick.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> Such as tend to the Hurt, not the Good of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</note> The Publick Good is the great End of all the divers Callings of Men, as you will ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. And conſequently nothing ought to be took up, as a Calling, which <hi>Impoveriſhes,</hi> or <hi>Corrupts the Manners of a People.</hi> And upon this Account therefore I ſhall not doubt to Arraign, and I wiſh the Magiſtrate would Univerſally Condemn the Calling of ſuch, who keep <hi>Tipling-houſes</hi> meerly to harbour Vagabonds and looſe People; and to draw Men into Riot and Exceſs, to the great Impoveriſhing of many Families, and the Creating of ſcandalous Breaches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Husbands and their Wives. An Inn-Keeper, whoſe Houſe is well ſituated for the Entertainment of the Traveller, upon his
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:151517:167"/> lawful Occaſions, is of great uſe in the Commonwealth. And tho' there be more of Temptation in his Calling than moſt others, yet if he takes care to prevent, as much as poſſible, all Swearing and Drunkenneſs within his Doors, all Lewdneſs and Wantonneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Servants; and will do all he can to diſcourage Rioting to unſeaſonable Hours, he will thereby do good Service to God, as well as his Country, by ſuch his Calling, and ſo Conſcientiouſly manag'd. But your mere <hi>Ale-houſe-keeping,</hi> where the whole Trade is to inveigle Perſons into Ill-husbandry, to the Expence of their Time and Money, and with all the Shifts and Contrivances to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain 'em, when they are got in, is ſo great a Peſt to this Nation; occaſions ſo much Immorality and Licentiouſneſs; ſo much Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Profaneſs, Lewdneſs and Wantonneſs; ſuch miſerable Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty amongſt the lower Rank of Houſe-keepers; ſuch Brawls and Contentions betwixt Husbands and Wives; and yields ſo much Harbour, and gives ſo much Encouragement to Thieves and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; that this Calling can hardly be ſuppos'd taken up in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary Places, by Vertuous and Honeſt Perſons, but is generally the laſt Reſerve of looſe and idle Livers, who would never endure to labour in an honeſt Employment. And therefore I would not have you, tho' you ſhould be brought into the ſoreſt Want, and be pincht with extream Neceſſity, ever take up ſo dangerous a Calling: I do ſay very moderately, ſo dangerous a Calling; for at beſt, there is the utmoſt danger of Ruine to your Innocency therein, and no One ſure, who has the leaſt tender Regard for his Soul, will take up ſuch a Calling, where there is but the leaſt Poſſibility left of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaping the Loſs thereof. And in this Rank alſo, as extreamly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to Religion and Morality, I think I may ſafely place the <hi>Calling of Players.</hi> I know how Touchy many will be on ſuch Perſons account. I ſhall therefore chooſe to expreſs my Opinion, concerning their Calling, in the Words of a very Learn'd, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Biſhop of our own Church; who does acknowledge, That <q>ſhould they be Try'd by the Bench of Fathers, and Councils of Old; or would have it put to moſt Voices amongſt later Divines, both Popiſh and Reformed, they would be utterly Caſt and Condemn'd: moſt holding, not the Calling only, but the very Practice and Thing it ſelf Unlawful and Damnable:</q> And how Pernicious they are to Religion and Manners, I ſhall have occaſion to ſhew hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Thirldly, <hi>Chriſtians muſt Renounce all thoſe wicked Arts, whereby ſome do Abuſe the moſt worthy and uſeful Callings,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>III.</hi> All ſinful Arts in the moſt uſeful Callings.</note> 
                     <hi>to ſerve their worldly Ends.</hi> And indeed there is no Calling, tho' never ſo good in it ſelf, but has its Temptations attending it, and Perſons of ill Principles and diſhoneſt Minds, will ſadly comply therewith. Thus even in the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> the moſt excellent and uſeful Calling in the World, ſince ſuch Multitudes <hi>will not endure ſound Doctrine,</hi> and few of the Greater ſort eſpecially, will without the utmoſt Indignation brook a Reproof; many are therefore Tempted to Temper their Doctrines to the Humour of their Party; and others to wink at the moſt ſcandalous Offences and Immoralities, thoſe great Reproaches of Chriſtianity. But if we ſhould be wholly in telling you your <hi>Priviledges in Chriſt,</hi> which the moſt Carnal Minds will love to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:151517:168"/> hear of, but little in Inſtructing you in the Duties of Religion, which are ſo neceſſary to the gaining of an Intereſt in him (which ſome ſort of People will call a <hi>Legal Preaching</hi>) we might perhaps thereby make our ſelves Dear to a Party, but we ſhould be Unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Chriſt. So again, ſhould we forbear to Reprove the Envy, the Malice, Pride, Cenſoriouſneſs, and Covetouſneſs under the Mask of Religion, of the Hypocrite on the one ſide, or the open and ſcandalous Profaneſs and Debaucheries of the Libertine (who calls himſelf of our Church) on the other, we ſhould be reckon'd amongſt thoſe wicked Prophets, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. who humour'd and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd the Opinions and Vices of God's People, and muſt expect that heavy Doom pronounc'd againſt ſuch in that Chapter.</p>
                  <p>And indeed as every other Calling has its particular Temptations belonging to it: So what is worſe, moſt Men think they may Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly enough comply therewith, and to think it indeed a neceſſary part of their Profeſſion ſo to do. Thus the Lawyer (a very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and uſeful Profeſſion in a Commonwealth, as being that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Property, and Right, and Peaceableneſs ſhould be maintained amongſt Men) may be Tempted perhaps, to think it a part of his Profeſſion to encourage Strife, and foment Differences; and that the Malice and Revenge, the Wrath and Bitterneſs; the Slanders and Evil-ſpeakings; the Strife and Contentions, which are other Men's Sins, muſt be his Livelihood: And that he muſt make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf acquainted by Drinking hard, with the worſt ſort of People, that he may gain an Intereſt himſelf in 'em, and get into Buſineſs. So likewiſe the Tradeſman will plead, that the Importunity of Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, who will certainly beat down the Price of his Commodities, as low as they can, does make it neceſſary by Proteſtations, and Equivocations, and Lyes, to ſet off his Wares to the beſt advantage. And how few are there of our Country-Dealers, who do not think it neceſſary (or they cannot pay a hard Rent, and maintain a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily) to take advantage of the Ignorance, or Neceſſity of their Neighbours; and not only to conceal the Defects, but by plain downright Lying and Avouching, that their Beaſt is upright and ſound, put it off for more than it is worth. Thus ſome Men, of all Profeſſions, will think they muſt do, or elſe they cannot live. And indeed, if Men could not get a Livelihood, but in a way and trade of Sinning, Perſons of Callings, and Profeſſions, and Dealers in in the World, would lie under a ſhrewd Temptation.</p>
                  <p>But tell me, muſt Men ſell their Souls to the Devil for ever, for the Gains here, we know not how ſoon we muſt leave? We count <hi>Eſau</hi> a fooliſh, as well as profane Perſon, who in Extremity of Hunger, ſold his Birthright for a Meſs of Pottage, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.33, 34. And what is that Chriſtian, who ſhall ſell his Eternal Inheritance for a Thing, in compariſon, of no Value?</p>
                  <p>But I can ſee no neceſſity of foregoing a Livelihood, or of yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Temptations of a Calling. Indeed, if by a Livelihood men did not mean living in Superfluity, Vanity, Luxury, which neither God, nor Nature has made neceſſary to any Man's Being, nor indeed Wel-being in the World: If they meant no more than getting an honeſt, and moderate Proviſion, ſuitable to the Station and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition Providence has plac'd 'em in, I do not know, but generally
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:151517:168"/> Men do better provide for themſelves, by plain and honeſt Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than by ſerving their Intereſts, by any ſinful Art, or Cunning whatſoever. I do believe it is a true Proverb, generally ſpeaking, that <hi>Honeſty is the beſt Policy;</hi> and Men Thrive, tho' but ſlowly by it, yet better and ſurer than by Cheating and Over-reaching. And it is almoſt every One's Obſervation, That a little Subſtance honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly got is a Comfort to the Owners, whilſt the Eſtate that is ill got waſts like Butter in the Sun, and derives down a Curſe upon thoſe on whom it deſcends.</p>
                  <p>But however, tho' it be not ſo, that Honeſty is the beſt way to Thrive, and tho' your Temptations ſhould be never ſo great, and your Wants never ſo preſſing, you muſt ſuffer that Want, or ſuffer worſe. And you would do well to conſider, that thoſe who will rather ſuffer Want here, than by ſinful Ways provide a Relief, ſhall be ſure not to want the Love, and Mercies of God hereafter, and that will abundantly Recompence for all defect of Advantages in this World.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, You muſt Renounce all Levity, and Deſultory Skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping from one Calling to another.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>IV.</hi> All Levity and Deſulto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Skipping from one Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> This may ſeem rather a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, than Religious Precept, becauſe in common Obſervation it is ſeldom ſeen, that the Man of ſeveral Trades and Callings does Thrive, and that the <hi>Rolling Stone</hi> never gathers <hi>Moſs.</hi> But it is an Inſtruction, which is alſo of a Religious Importance, for 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.20. <hi>Every Man is</hi> commanded <hi>to Abide in the ſame Calling, wherein he was called.</hi> And tho' it may be Lawful to lay down One, and <q>to take up another Profeſſion, or Trade, when either abſolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity enforceth it, or lawful Authority enjoineth it; or a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of weighty Circumſtances faithfully, and diſcreetly, and ſoberly laid together, ſeemeth to require it; as the Judicious Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon</hi> Stateth this Caſe: Yet this muſt be done, as he ſays, with all due Caution; as Firſt, not out of Lightneſs, and Unſettledneſs; nor Secondly, out of the Greedineſs of a Covetous, or Ambitious Luſt; nor Thirdly, out of Sullenneſs, or Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſs at our preſent Condition; nor Laſtly, out of Envy againſt our Neighbour, that liveth by us.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But above all, that Change of Callings is to be Renounced, as the higheſt Profaneneſs, when Laymen and Tradeſmen, nay, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (as amongſt the Quakers, ſo expreſly contrary to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.34.) do Sacrilegiouſly uſurp the ſacred Office of the Miniſtry, and ſet up for Teachers without a lawful Call, or Ordination thereunto. Nor is there any Force in what they'll pretend from <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. where it is ſaid of all Chriſtians in general, <hi>That Chriſt hath made them Kings and Prieſts unto God, and his Father;</hi> for the ſame is ſpoke, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.6. of the whole Jewiſh Nation, that <hi>They ſhould be a Kingdom of Prieſts, and an holy Nation.</hi> And yet we find that the Prieſthood was ſo much a ſeparated Office a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and ſo dangerous to be Uſurpt, that <hi>Korah</hi> and his Company paid dearly for Attempting it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. as alſo <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah,</hi> as you will ſee 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The reaſon of that high Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. wherein Chriſtians in general are call'd Prieſts, is the ſame as in <hi>Exod.</hi> For as the whole Jewiſh Nation were there ſtyl'd a <hi>Kingdom of Prieſts, and a Holy Nation,</hi> with reſpect to the Pagan
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:151517:169"/> World, from whom they were to be as much ſeparated by a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Holineſs, as the Prieſthood amongſt 'em was from the People. So we Chriſtians, ſuch is our Holy Calling, are to be as much ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and diſtinguiſht from Jews and Gentiles both, by our Holy Living, as the Goſpel Miniſtry are by a ſacred Character, from the reſt of Chriſtian People.</p>
                  <p>No certainly, all thoſe of the Laity, who uſurp the Office of the Miniſtry, ſhould learn Sobriety, and to keep themſelves within the proper Bounds and Limits of their Callings, conſidering that equally now, as in the Jewiſh Church, <hi>The Prieſt's lips ſhould keep Knowledge, and that they ſhould ſeek the Law at his mouth, for he is the Meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> Mal. 27.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>V.</hi> Any Calling whatſoever is to be declin'd for which a Perſon is not Qualified, both by Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and Inclinations.</note>Fifthly, And that you may not lightly, and with a worſe Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than that of Inconſtancy, change your Calling; <hi>Decline that Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling whatever, how Creditable, or how Profitable ſoever it be, for which you are not Qualify'd both by Education, Abilities, and Inclination.</hi> The great Fault in this reſpect is commonly the Parents, who <hi>Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> as it were, their Children to ſuch Callings, as they pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without conſulting thoſe other Requiſites now named, to make them Excellent and Uſeful to themſelves, or others therein; and this is the reaſon, that ſo many miſ-carry in their Callings, to their own Ruine and Diſgrace, and the Diſappointment and Damage of others in the Buſineſs they undertake.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Eſpecially Callings of great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſuch as the Miniſtry.</note>And according, as is the Importance of any Calling, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly does it the more concern Perſons, both for their own ſakes, and the World's, that they decline ſuch as they are not fitted for by a <hi>ſuitable Education,</hi> by <hi>competent Abilities,</hi> and <hi>Gifts,</hi> and by a <hi>ſtrong Inclination thereunto.</hi> Now the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> is a Calling of the vaſteſt Conſequence in the World, even the Salvation of many Souls, depending upon a Man's being duly Qualify'd thereto. There ought in the firſt place to be a ſuitable Education, in thoſe <hi>Schools of the Prophets,</hi> our <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities,</hi> given to ſuch as are Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates for it, that they may be prepar'd thereto by the Knowledge of thoſe learn'd Languages, wherein the Inſpir'd Writers did Pen the Holy Scriptures, and by many other Arts and Sciences, which are Hand-maids to Divinity, and can there only be ſufficiently attain'd to. There ought next to be great Abilities and Gifts, both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Parts, and Divine Graces, and a good ſhare of all ſorts of Learning acquir'd by much Study, and great Induſtry, to make an uſeful Divine; there being no one Profeſſion in the World, which requires to its Perfection, ſuch an univerſal Knowledge, as <hi>Theology</hi> does. And to all theſe there muſt be added ſtrong <hi>Inclinations</hi> to the Holy Office; <hi>Inclinations</hi> to it, not upon the account of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, and Dignities that attend it, but for the Works ſake; <hi>Inclinations</hi> indeed to be an Inſtrument of God's Glory, and of the Salvation of Men's Souls therein. And now, if a Perſon of no good Abilities, or Gifts ſhould be <hi>determin'd</hi> to the Miniſtry, it is a Sacrilegious Profaneneſs of equal Guilt, as it is Impiety in ſome Parents, who think ſuch of the moſt promiſing Parts amongſt their Children, an Offering too good for the Lord. Or if a Perſon of a ſuitable <hi>Education,</hi> and of great Abilities, that fit him for it, ſhould enter into it with an unwilling Mind, it is often too great a
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:151517:169"/> ſign of unſanctify'd Affections, that would be for greater Liberty and Gaiety, than the Gravity and Seriouſneſs of his Profeſſion will allow him; and the Fop ſhould be counted unworthy of it. Or, laſtly, if there be never ſo ſtrong Inclinations to be a Teacher, without the Preparations of an Univerſity-Education, and learned Abilities, as well as Divine Graces, it ſhews the Perſon to be One of thoſe, who <hi>Deſiring to be Teachers of the Law, underſtood neither what they ſaid, nor whereof they affirmed,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.7.</p>
                  <p>And indeed in any Calling whatſoever, there muſt be a joint con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of every one of theſe fore-mention'd Qualifications; for if any one of 'em be wanting, that Perſon will be unſucceſsful in his Calling; inſomuch that if there be never ſo ſuitable an Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and good Abilities, if there be wanting that one other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite of ſtrong Inclinations to ſuch a Courſe of Life, the Buſineſs of it will be carried on with <hi>Sloth and Negligence,</hi> which is the</p>
                  <p>Sixth <hi>Thing, that muſt be Renounced, as to any Calling.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>VI.</hi> Idleneſs in any Calling is to be renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> Idleneſs has the ſame Effect in any other Calling, as <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerv'd it had in the Husband-man's, concerning whom he tells us, <hi>That going by the Field of the Slothful, and by the Vineyard of the man void of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, lo it was all grown over with Thorns, and Nettles had covered the face thereof,</hi> Prov. 24.30, 31. Thereby the Underſtanding of the Scholar is over-ſpread with Ignorance; the Manners of the Gentleman with Barbarity and Savageneſs; and Poverty and Nakedneſs do enter, through Sloth, the Houſes of Tradeſmen. But on the other ſide, how comfortable are the Fruits of Induſtry, either in Man, or Woman? Particularly as to the Woman's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, there is ſuch an Account given thereof, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. from the 10 <hi>ver.</hi> to the End of that <hi>Chap.</hi> as ſhews the mighty Happineſs to Husband, Children, and Servants, where ſuch a One is the Miſtreſs of the Family; and her Character ought to be got by Heart, by every Perſon of her Sex. And therefore the Effects of Sloth being ſo diſmal and miſerable; but the Fruits of Induſtry ſo very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and comfortable, according as the Wiſe-man adviſes, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.10. <hi>Whatſoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, but it is enough you'll ſay, for thoſe to be Induſtrious,<note place="margin">Idleneſs not allowable, no not in Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> who are to <hi>Live by their Calling:</hi> But as for ſuch, who enjoy a ſufficiency and plenty of the Neceſſaries, Conveniencies, and Superfluities of this World; what occaſion is there that they ſhould be Induſtrious: For as it is commonly ſaid, <hi>What is a Gentleman, but his Pleaſures?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But give me leave to anſwer in the words of an excellent Perſon, that if this be true, <q>If a Gentleman be nothing elſe but this, then truly he is a ſad Piece, the moſt inconſiderable, the moſt deſpicable, the moſt pitiful and wretched Creature in the World.</q> If it be his Priviledge to do nothing, then it is his Priviledge to be good for nothing, to be a meer Weight and Burthen upon the Earth; nay the Peſt and Plague of Mankind, ſince the Soul of Man is that active Power, that if it does not actuate and employ a Man in doing Good, it will certainly in doing Miſchief: So that to ſay thus of the Gentleman, or Man of Fortunes, is highly to Reproach him. But the Contrary is moſt certain.</p>
                  <p>And no Man, be he in never ſo flouriſhing a State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, muſt give himſelf up to Idleneſs, as being one of the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:151517:170"/> greateſt Temptations in the World to Sin, and in it ſelf a Life very diſpleaſing to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">It is one of the greateſt Temptations in the World to Sin.</note>
                     <hi>Idleneſs,</hi> I ſay, <hi>is one of the greateſt Temptations in the World to Sin.</hi> So great a Temptation indeed it is, that the idle Perſon <hi>Tempts</hi> the Devil to come and Tempt him. That wicked Spirit <hi>Continually walketh about the Earth, ſeeking whom he may devour;</hi> and ſpying a Perſon to be Idle, he infallibly lies down before him. He muſters up all his Forces to beleaguer that Man, ſends for the like idle and licentious Perſons as himſelf, and thoſe with all poſſible Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements inveigle him to join with 'em in their wicked Courſes. And his Mind being taken up with no honeſt Cares, the Devil throws into his Soul a Thouſand ill Thoughts, and baſe Deſigns, and lewd Imaginations to corrupt him, and make him yield. And the greateſt of Men and Saints, have been overcome meerly by being found Idle, as we have an eminent Inſtance in <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 11.2. <hi>Who walking on the roof of his Houſe,</hi> his Mind then roving, and being untackt from honeſt Cares, that Temptation ſeiz'd on him, whereby he was plung'd into that woful Miſcarriage, in the Matter of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> which did create him ſo much Sorrow, did make ſuch a Spot in his Life, as was never waſht off, no not with his Tears of Repentance: So excellent was the Advice of the Father; <hi>Be always doing ſomething, that the Devil may never find thee Idle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">And is it ſelf a very great Sin.</note>Nor is the Idleneſs of Perſons in a plentiful and flouriſhing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>in it ſelf leſs a Sin,</hi> than it is a Temptation to other Sins. Theſe are the Perſons, who have Talents given 'em, and their Idleneſs is expreſt by <hi>Hiding their Talents in the Earth,</hi> Mat. 25.25. which how great a Sin it is, is evident from our Saviour's ſevere Menaces thereupon, calling ſuch an idle Perſon a <hi>Wicked and ſlothful Servant, and commanding him to be caſt,</hi> becauſe an unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Servant, <hi>into outer darkneſs, where ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth,</hi> ver. 30. It is remarkable, that here the wicked Servant is ſo ſeverely Doom'd, not for miſ-employing, but for being Idle, and not employing his Talent: So that no Man's Condition, be it never ſo Plentiful, will excuſe him in Idleneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Laſtly, no man muſt live above his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note>
                     <hi>The laſt Thing to be Renounced, with reference to a Calling, is the Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above it.</hi> This is what the Vanity and Pride of many, both Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Tradeſmen, and others, do tempt 'em to; but the iſſue thereof is in a ſhort time to be Needy and Borrowing, and conſequently Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, and to meet with Scorn inſtead of that Reſpect they ſeek, by making an outward Appearance and Flouriſh. But the worſt of it is, when Men are of this Humour, to live above their Calling, in order to maintain their Port and Pride, they are forc'd, if Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to oppreſs their Tenants; if Tradeſmen, to cheat and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach their Cuſtomers, and to uſe all the evil Arts of Getting. And as to the latter, when they ſo far ſcorn the meanneſs of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, as to throw it aſide, it is not ſeldom, that in the End they take to the High-way, as the only means of maintaining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. In ſhort therefore to prevent the fatal Effects of both theſe laſt Evils, Idleneſs, and living beyond a Man's Calling, my Advice to young Perſons is to be Induſtrious, till ſuch time at leaſt, as they have laid up a Stock, whereby they may afford to live more at eaſe, and not to throw off the meaneſt Calling, till they are able to live
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:151517:170"/> Creditably without it. And ſo much for the Callings of the World, and what is to be Renounced with Relation to them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Let us conſider amongſt thoſe Things of the World of a middle Nature, the different Conditions and States of Men therein.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> Amongſt thoſe things of the World of a middle Nature, the different Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and States of men therein are to be conſider'd.</note> And the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Part are in the State, either of <hi>Maſters,</hi> or of <hi>Servants.</hi> And the whole World are either <hi>Single,</hi> or <hi>Married Perſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Firſt, as to the State and Condition of a Maſter, there are very great Advantages and Opportunities, which the Head of a Family has of doing Good amongſt thoſe of his Houſhold; inſomuch that if he keep up an orderly and religious Diſcipline in his Family, it will be no hard matter for him, ſo to form the Principles and Practices of his Servants and Dependants, as to be able to undertake with <hi>Joſhua,</hi> 24.15. that he, and his Houſe, ſhall ſerve the Lord.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> A Master has great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of doing Good.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet this, as all other Conditions of Men in this World, is liable to be abuſed to great degrees of Diſhonour to God, and Injury to the Souls of Men, as namely when thoſe, who are Maſters do ſo far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in their Commands, as to give no leiſure to their Servants to provide for the Good of their own Souls.</p>
                  <p>But ſuch a Dominion as this muſt be utterly Renounced,<note place="margin">But all that Dominion is to be utterly renounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, which treats Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Slaves and Brutes.</note> and it ſhould be a Thing never heard of amongſt Chriſtians, that a Servant ſhould be ſuch a Slave, as to be treated no better than a Brute: And as Paſture is the only thing provided for the latter, ſo bodily Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſhould be the only thing took care of for the former. No, every one that will expect <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Bleſſing and Favour with God, muſt have <hi>Abraham</hi>'s pious Care of the religious Education and Government both of his Children and Servants; concerning whom it is Recorded, that God did impart unto him a very great Secret, under the Notion of a ſingular Favour, upon this very Account, That <hi>He knew he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Children, and his Houſhold after him, that they ſhould keep the way of the Lord, to do Juſtice and Judgment,</hi> Gen. 18.19. So that when any of you ſhall grow up, or arrive to that Condition, to be the Heads of a Family, this muſt be alſo your Care, and you muſt ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Renounce the Treating your Servants at that Diſtance, as if they were not Fellow-ſervants with you to the ſame God.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, And even in the Married State, all thoſe worldly Cares, which choak up, or diſturb Religion, muſt be utterly laid aſide, as will be fully ſhew'd you under the Next, and</p>
                  <p>Laſt of thoſe things pertaining to this World, which afford great matter of Temptation to us, <hi>viz. The Cares thereof.</hi> Now as to the Cares of this World, true it is, we have many worldly Intereſts and Engagements to mind, we have the Neceſſities,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> And Engage too much in worldly Cares</note> both of our own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and of thoſe who belong to us, to ſerve. Nor is any thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for us without Induſtry and Endeavour; ſo that by the Neceſſity of our Condition we are, every One of us, more or leſs, ſome in one way, ſome in another, engag'd in worldly Affairs. Hence it is,<note place="margin">Laſtly, the Cares of this World, the laſt of thoſe Things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to it, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> that ſome Care about the Things of this World is allow'd us; nay, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we are commanded <hi>to continue in the Calling, wherein God hath ſet us,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.20, and we are warn'd, that <hi>we be not ſlothful in Buſineſs,</hi> Rom. 12.11.</p>
                  <p>But the great Unhappineſs and Sin of many in this difficult caſe, is this; That a moderate Concern for the Things of this World being Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable, they are apt to Overwhelm themſelves in a multiplicity of Cares: As alſo to let the Cares of this world to Alienate their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from God, and Heavenly Things; and to withdraw their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention from him, in thoſe Divine Services, they are bound to Pay him. And few, who are far engag'd in Temporal Deſigns and Cares, know when to Retire from the world, and to throw them off; ſo as to give themſelves a ſufficient Time to prepare for a better Life. But as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as worldly Cares are in moſt Men's Circumſtances; yet</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>It becomes Chriſtians to Renounce that Multiplicity of Cares,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> It becomes Chriſtians to renounce a multiplicity of Cares.</note> 
                     <hi>which diſtracts their Thoughts, and ſhews 'em to have no other Aims, but at this World.</hi> And yet ſo it is, that ſome Men fill their Heads with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Projects, and do ſo Overwhelm themſelves with Variety of Buſineſs, that they do ſcarcely allow themſelves time to Eat and Sleep. But to be in a perpetual Hurry after this World's Goods, and to be ſo over-ſolicitous for our future Proviſion in it, is an Argument of Men's Diſcontent with that Condition, wherein Providence has plac'd 'em; and of an anxious Fear, they ſhall not be ſufficiently Provided for by God's Bleſſing, concurring with an honeſt Induſtry in their Affairs: And is ſuch a Care, as however it might become Pagans, who knew little of the Doctrine of God's Providence in this Life, and of his Treaſures of Bliſs, provided for us in another; Yet is infinitely unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Chriſtians, who are throughly Inſtructed in the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Care over us, and his future Proviſions for us; and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo ſtrictly forbid us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. from the 24th Verſe, to the End.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It behoves us Chriſtians ſo far to Renounce any Worldly Care, as it does Alienate our Affections from God, and Heavenly Things;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> Every world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Care, ſo far as it does a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienate our Affections from God, and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Things.</note> 
                     <hi>and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw our Attention from him, in the Services we are bound to Pay him,</hi> as is too often. I ſay, as is too often. For hence it is, that ſo many do neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Holy Duties, both Publick and Private, and that they Perform either with ſo little Devotion. Hence it is, that many come ſo ſeldom to Church; or when they do, that they carry themſelves in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Prayer, Praiſes, and at the Hearing of the Word, with ſo much Coldneſs, Lazineſs, and want of Attention. And hence alſo it
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:151517:172"/> is, that at Home there is ſo ſeldom any Family-Prayers, and Reading of the Scriptures, and good Books. And I wiſh, <hi>That riſing up early, and ſitting up late, and eating the Bread of Carefulneſs,</hi> may not hinder ſome from Paying any Devotion to God, as much as Privately by themſelves, every Morning and Evening. And yet this is the leaſt that can be imply'd in thoſe Precepts of <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.1. <hi>Men ought always to Pray,</hi> and 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.17. where we are enjoin'd to <hi>Pray without ceaſing.</hi> And to be Negligent, or Inattentive, through the Incumbrance of worldly Cares, at the Hearing of the Word, was the Thing for which our Saviour Reprov'd <hi>Martha,</hi> who was <hi>Cumbring her ſelf with much Serving,</hi> when ſhe ought to have Liſten'd to our Saviour's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtructions, as <hi>Mary</hi> did, for which He Commended her, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.40, 41, 42. And therefore it behoves every Chriſtian, when he enters into the Houſe of God, or into his own Cloſet, wholly to lay aſide all worldly Cares for that Time, and to ſay to 'em, as Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>Stay you here, whilſt I go and Pray yonder.</hi>

                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> All manner of worldly Care, when Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd in Years.</note>Laſtly, <hi>All Perſons, whether more, or leſs engag'd in worldly Cares, when grown in Years, ſhould wholly in a manner throw them off, and Retiring as much as may be from the World, ſhould employ the remainder of their Time in clearing their Accompts with God and Man, and in preparing themſelves for the Great Tryal.</hi> And yet it is commonly obſerv'd, that the farther Men advance in Years, the more Covetous and Worldly they grow; but this is the moſt unreaſonable and abſurd Thing that can be: For what means the Cares of this World, but to provide for our ſelves, or Poſterity? Now as to our ſelves, the nearer Life draws to an End, the leſs of temporal Proviſions are neceſſary. And as to Poſterity, the beſt Proviſion that can be made for them, is what may be enough to be a Foundation for their Induſtry, and not ſo much as will diſ-engage 'em from Buſineſs and Employment; for to leave 'em great Eſtates, is but to expoſe 'em to the Temptations of Idleneſs, Luxury, and the worſt of Sins: To which, as all Men in great Poſſeſſions are liable, ſo none more than ſuch, who have been ſuddenly rais'd by the Covetouſneſs of a worldly Miſer. As therefore thoſe Men of Buſineſs, who would be counted the only Wiſe, will not ſhew themſelves in the End the greateſt Fools, when they have Advanc'd far in Years, at leaſt-wiſe, they ſhould look upon that Advice of the Prophet, as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly directed to them, <hi>Set thy houſe in order, for thou ſhalt ſurely dye, and not live:</hi> Such Men have receiv'd more Talents than others, and therefore they ought to take more time to State their Accompts, that they may come off at the Great Audit, with the Approbation of having been good and faithful Servants.</p>
                  <p>In a Word, and to Conclude this Head, <hi>The Conſideration of the World,</hi> upon which we have been ſo long, you would do well to bear thoſe Scriptural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions always in Mind, <hi>To ſet your Affection on things above, and not on things on the Earth,</hi> Col. 3.2. <hi>Not to Love the World,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.15. <hi>To be Careful for Nothing,</hi> Phil. 4.6. <hi>And to take no Thought for to Morrow,</hi> Matth. 6.34. The Meaning of which Expreſſions is, That we ſhould Love God, and Heavenly Things in the firſt Place, and Abandon all immoderate Cares concerning Worldly Things. That we muſt beſtow much more of our Care, how we may ſerve God accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and provide for the Immortal Happineſs of our Souls, than how to Attain this World's Goods. And in an honeſt Induſtry and Endeavour, to Attain a Sufficiency thereof, to carry us thro' this Vale of Miſery, we muſt commit the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of all our Labours to God, and truſt him with the Event, who will take care, <hi>That all things ſhall work together for Good, for them who Fear him,</hi> Rom. 8.20.</p>

                  <p>THE Point that we are now upon, being to lay before you the Strength of thoſe Temptations, which do ariſe, Firſt, <hi>From the World,</hi> Secondly, <hi>From the wicked World,</hi> and Thirdly, <hi>From the Pomps and Vanity of this wicked World:</hi> And as to the Firſt, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Having ſufficiently diſcover'd what Temptations to Sin we ſhall meet with, both from the <hi>World in General,</hi> and the <hi>ſeveral Things</hi> therein contain'd, in <hi>Particular,</hi> I come now,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>To give you a Survey likewiſe of the wicked World, and to ſhew you alſo in what Sence, and how far you are to Renounce the wicked World.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> What's meant by the wicked World, and how far, and in what ſence we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it.</note> And by the wicked World can be properly meant no other than <hi>wicked Men,</hi> there being no Creature on Earth, beſides Man, that is capable of doing any thing morally Good, or Evil, ſo as to be ſtyl'd from the latter, <hi>Wicked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if you would be farther ſatisfy'd, who theſe are, who may be ſo ſtyl'd; it ſeems to me, that it is not every Sinner however, that either in the Language of the Scripture, or in common Account,<note place="margin">Thereby is meant ſuch as make it their Buſineſs, like that wicked One, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, to Tempt others to Sin.</note> is call'd a <hi>wicked Man:</hi> But it muſt be ſome One of a more than ordinary Impiety, ſo as to approach ſomething near Satan himſelf in Sin and Wickedneſs, that can deſerve ſo Black a Character. Now the Devil is often term'd in Scripture, <hi>The wicked One;</hi> and particularly <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.19. he is ſo ſtyl'd on the account of his Tempting others to Sin. <hi>His catching away the Word which is ſown in Men's Hearts,</hi> or his injecting of vain Thoughts into the Minds of the Hearers, that they may not be Converted by the Preaching of the Goſpel: (one of his ways of Tempting us to Sin, as was before ſhew'd) It is this that gave him that Character of the <hi>wicked One.</hi> And on the very ſame account of his Tempting the World to Sin, is his great Agent, <hi>Anti-Chriſt,</hi> call'd alſo, 2 Theſ. 2.8. <hi>That wicked One.</hi> He is term'd in the 4 <hi>ver. He that oppoſeth God,</hi> and here in this 8 <hi>ver.</hi> he is ſtyl'd <hi>The wicked One,</hi> becauſe of his <hi>Coming after the working of Satan with all deceivableneſs of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs,</hi> as it follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10. that is, becauſe he imitates the Devil by his cunning Tempting of others into Sin, and by Deceiving 'em into Unrighteous, Irreligious Courſes, he is therefore call'd the wicked One. And upon the ſame account therefore, as thoſe only are properly wicked Men, who are
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:151517:173"/> guilty of ſome notorious Crime themſelves; ſo eſpecially ſuch, who make it any part of their Buſineſs to <hi>Corrupt and Tempt</hi> others to Sin, are the wicked Men of the World.</p>
                  <p>And according to thoſe Degrees of Tempting, of which Men are guilty, are they to be eſteemed more, or leſs <hi>Wicked, and Diabolically ſo.</hi> Some Men's Temptations are leſs <hi>Extenſive,</hi> and reach no farther than the Neighbourhood, where they are known, and the Company they converſe with. But others there are, whoſe Temptations may reach even unto the utmoſt Parts of the Earth; ſuch are thoſe, who propagate and promote by their Writings, or Diſcourſes, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtical and Heretical Principles: And ſuch are moſt of our Modern Writers of Play-Books, and Songs, whoſe Plays and Poetry ſeem deſign'd to nouriſh Profaneneſs and Immorality. Now ſuch Temptations as theſe will extend to all Parts, where things of that Nature ſhall reach, and will be Temptations in all Ages, ſo long as there will be found wicked Men like themſelves, to propagate and promote the ſame. The former ſort may be compar'd to an Inferior Rank of Evil Spirits, whoſe Province of doing Miſchief is more narrow and confin'd: But the latter are, as it were, Maſter Devils; <hi>Like roaring Lions, they are continually walking about the Earth, ſeeking whom they may devour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now you muſt heartily Renounce, and Refuſe to Conform your ſelves to thoſe wicked Men, either Firſt, <hi>By becoming Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters your ſelves of other People:</hi> Or, Secondly, <hi>By yielding of your ſelves to be overcome by others Temptations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>You muſt Renounce that Diabolical Wickedneſs of becoming Tempters your ſelves of other Perſons.</hi>

                     <hi>Renounce,</hi> do I ſay? You muſt Abhor, Abominate, and Deteſt this their Wickedneſs of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting others, and of Tempting 'em to Sin, as being a Practice, that of all others will render you likeſt to the Devil. And I am ſure you would of all things in the World deteſt this Piece of Villany, if you would but attentively conſider that one remarkable Place of Scripture, ſhewing you the high Impiety of ſuch a Wickedneſs. It is <hi>Acts</hi> 13.8, 9, 10. <hi>Elymas the Sorcerer withſtood</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Paul, <hi>ſeeking to turn away the Deputy from the Faith: Then</hi> Paul <hi>filled with the Holy Ghoſt, ſet his Eyes on him, and ſaid, O full of Subtilty and all Miſchief, thou Child of the Devil, thou Enemy of all Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wilt thou not ceaſe to pervert the right ways of the Lord?</hi> Do you ſee here with what unuſual Indignation, and in what ſevere Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage the Apoſtle does beſpeak this Wretch, meerly upon his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to <hi>Tempt the Deputy from the right way of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſurely not without Reaſon; for certainly it muſt be a terrible Conſideration to any One, that he has been the Inſtrument and Cauſe of another's Damnation.<note place="margin">It is a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing to have been an Inſtrument of another's Damnation.</note> For ſhould ſuch a One ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after return to a right Mind (and he will be infinitely miſerable, if he does not) as his Repentance, if it be ſincere, will make him a Lover, not only of his own, but of other Men's Souls: So what An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh will it give him, to think, that 'tis to be fear'd, there are now thoſe in Hell Flames, whom his ill Example, or vicious Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or baſe and corrupting Flatteries in wicked Courſes, or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to Vertue, or Encouragements to Sin, have ſent there, never to be Retriev'd.</p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:151517:173"/>
                  <p>It is an Injury to men's Souls, in ſome Caſes hardly ever, in others impoſſible to be Repair'd.<note place="margin">It is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to Men's Souls, in ſome Caſes hardly ever, in others impoſſible to be Repair'd.</note> If his Temptations have been of that ſort, as to reach no farthar than he was Known, or was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant, a very Eminent, and very ſignal Repentance may, in ſome meaſure, put a ſtop to the Contagion thereof; ſo that they ſpread no farther (tho' not that altogether, for ſome perhaps, whom he has Corrupted, will never be Reclaim'd, tho' he be never ſo great a Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and Labour himſelf never ſo much their Converſion:) But if his Temptations have been of that more ſpreading and laſting Kind, now ſpoke, and he has been One, that has <hi>Wrote Ill Books,</hi> been a <hi>Broacher of Peſtilent Hereſies,</hi> an <hi>Author of lewd Plays, or wanton and prophane Verſe,</hi> the Miſchief and Poyſon of ſuch Temptations do fly beyond his Recalling; and tho' he may Burn 'em with his own Hands, yet others will Rake 'em out of the Aſhes. And it is the Opinion of ſome of the Ancients, that ſuch Temptations as theſe, will affect his Happineſs even in Heaven it ſelf; inſomuch that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Miſchief thereof does daily ſpread, and more do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be Damn'd thereby, proportionably ſuch a One will ſtill fall thereupon lower, and lower in Glory. I know nothing in Reaſon, or Religion, that contradicts this Opinion. However it be, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is the higheſt Misfortune can befal any One, that he is, or ever has been amongſt that Rank of Sinners, whom the Scripture does ſo peculiarly Stile the <hi>Wicked,</hi> and that becauſe of their ſo near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to the Tempter himſelf. Theſe are the Perſons <hi>by whom Offences come,</hi> and it is a terrible Threatning, that of our Saviour's, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.6. to ſuch, <hi>Who ſo ſhall offend one of theſe little Ones, which believe in me,</hi> that is, any-wiſe Tempt, Gall, Diſcourage, drive from the Faith and Practice of a Chriſtian, any the meaneſt Perſon that comes to me; whoſo ſhall do this, <hi>It were better for him, that a Mill-ſtone were hanged about his Neck, and he were caſt into the midſt of the Sea:</hi> So that of all things in the World, it concerns you, to take care, ye never become Tempters of others to Sin, and either to omit that, which is Good, or to commit that, which is Evil.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Nor does it leſs concern you to refuſe Conforming your ſelves to wicked Men, when they ſhall Tempt you;</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>It has been ever obſerv'd, that Examples have a much greater Influence than Precepts,<note place="margin">Examples have the greateſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon us; eſpecially</note> and that moſt are readier to do what they ſee, than what they hear. More particularly, there is a great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination in us to follow the Examples of Sin; eſpecially if many, if the Examples of thoſe, for whom we have an high Eſteem, and of whom we do ſtand in great Awe.</p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:151517:174"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And,</hi> Firſt, <hi>We are eſpecially inclin'd to follow the Examples of Sin;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> If Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Sin.</note> For Sin is what our Corrupt Nature is of it ſelf diſpos'd to; and if moreover Examples do come in to help us forward, theſe will highten our Deſires, and ſilence our Conſciences, and give us ſome plauſible Pretence to Sin. It looks like ſome Act of Modeſty, and Self-denial, to deny our own private Judgment, and to go along with the Croud; when our Fleſh is craving, and our Luſts are up, it is a ſtrange En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to us to Sin in Company, and fulfil 'em. This heartens us againſt our Fears, and abates the Dread of Puniſhment, which would follow the Satisfaction of our Luſts. Now if we are puniſht for 'em, it will not be we alone, and it is a Comfort to have Fellows in Miſeries, and a Man dares both do, and ſuffer many things in Company, which he would have been diſ-hearten'd to have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd on ſingly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But,</hi> Secondly, <hi>We are ſtill more hearten'd to Sin, if the Examples thereof are Common, and Many.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> If common, and many.</note> For why? Beſides that there is a great deal of Proneneſs and Propenſion in all our Natures to Vice and Wickedneſs, the only Reſtraint upon our Inclinations, that we break not out ſuddenly into all Exorbitancy of Ungodlineſs, is as inwardly from the Innate Turpitude and Baſeneſs of Sin: So outwardly from the burning and ſhining Lights, and glorious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Vertue, that are abroad in the World. Now our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſe of the Filthineſs of Sin ſoon ceaſes, when we ſee it Practic'd by the moſt, and thoſe as ſhrew'd, and as wiſe Perſons as our ſelves; and from without, there can be no upbraiding and ill Report, in giving ſwing to our naughty Deſires, if Vice has once got its Multitudes of Followers, and the Generality of Men of its ſide.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>But farther yet, Examples of Sin are very Contagious, if they are the Examples of ſuch, for whom we have a great Eſteem.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>III.</hi> If of ſuch, for whom we have a great Eſteem.</note> Perſons of all Sects and Parties in Religion fix upon ſome in their own way, as very excellent Perſons, and exact Patterns, fit to be imitated in all they do, (as if Men were not Men ſtill, and the Beſt were not ſubject to Miſtake and Failing) whatever Duty of Chriſtianity theſe Men, whom they particularly Admire, ſeem to have but a ſmall regard to, they do not think it at all neceſſary, becauſe ſuch a Good Man, would not, if it were, be wanting in it, they think. And ſo as to any ſinful Practice on the other ſide: Why ſhould I ſcruple to do ſo and ſo, thou wilt ſay, when ſuch a One, and I am ſure he underſtands what he does, ſticks not to do the like. He is a wiſe Man, a good Man, nay, and a Scholar, and yet does ſo and ſo, nor does he fear going to Heaven for all that.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>But above all, the Examples of Sin are the moſt prevalent, when they are backt with the Authority of thoſe, whom we ſtand in awe of.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>IV.</hi> If of thoſe of whom we ſtand in awe.</note> Theſe are the Men who will expect, not only to be Obey'd, but Honour'd. And if we Ape and Imitate 'em in all their Ways, we may hope thereby to obtain their Favour. If we ſhew a diſlike of their Courſes, we may have reaſon to fear their Diſpleaſure. And what is it that Two ſuch active Springs in our Nature, as our <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Fears</hi> are, will not force us to, or drive us from? So powerful you ſee are the Examples of Sin, when they are backt with all theſe Advantages.</p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:151517:174"/>
                  <p>And now the Examples of Sin have all theſe Advantages in 'em, to influence you to Conform your ſelves unto 'em. Ever ſince the unhappy Fall of Man, there is in every Child of <hi>Adam</hi> a great deal of Proneneſs to Sin, rather than to Vertue. Alas! We carry a Principle about us, which is not only buiſy and ready to cloſe with the Temptations of others Examples, but is forward to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray us to Sin, tho' we had few Examples for it. Nay, evil In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and corrupt Deſires are ſo powerful within us, that even the beſt Inſtructions, and the moſt pious Examples, and all other good Means and Helps, are daily found too weak and unable to Overcome 'em. And yet as if all this were little enough, there are far more Examples abroad in the World of Wickedneſs, than of Goodneſs; inſomuch that by the <hi>World</hi> in Scripture, ſimply taken, is often meant no other, than <hi>wicked Men,</hi> they make up ſo great a Part thereof. And not only too many Great Men, whom you have an Awe of, do give moſt abominable Examples of Profaneneſs, Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Drunkenneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to their Inferiours; but to come nearer Home to you, too few of your Parents and Maſters, I am afraid, are Examples to you of Religion, and of the Fear of God. Nay, and perhaps ſome that you have an Eſteem for, and you may take for Good Men, may be Examples of Schiſm and Separation, and of breaking the Unity of the Church, and Deſpiſers of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or in one Kind, or other, not ſo Good as they ſhould be, not entirely and uniformly Good.</p>
                  <p>And now what muſt you do in this Caſe? Why by all means you muſt Renounce and Refuſe Conformity to ſuch bad Examples.<note place="margin">We muſt by all Means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to ſuch bad Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: For</note> You muſt by no means follow the Examples of Sin, be they who, or what they will. Let them be never ſo many, you muſt not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a Multitude to do Evil, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.2. It will not afford the leaſt Eaſe to the Torments of the Damned, that they are the many, and that they Saved are the few. Nor muſt the Examples of the <hi>Greateſt,</hi> no, nor of thoſe you count <hi>Good Men,</hi> be a Rule to you, when they vary from the Laws of God. There is no Man ſo <hi>Great, Wiſe,</hi> or <hi>Good,</hi> that he can diſpenſe with God's Laws, and abſolve you from your Allegiance to the Sovereign Lord of Heaven and Earth. This Great Man, or that Parent, or Maſter, to flatter and pleaſe whom, you do follow their Examples in Sinning againſt God, and your own Soul, cannot afford you Protection from God's Wrath, nor Reſcue you from under the Stroak of Divine Vengeance: No, but he ſhall be as liable to it himſelf, as the pooreſt Slave.</p>
                  <p>No, Firſt, a Chriſtian, a Souldier of Jeſus Chriſt, is call'd out to Combat againſt the wicked Examples of the World, as much as againſt any one ſort of Enemy in his Chriſtian Warfare;<note place="margin">

We read the 2d of <hi>Kings,</hi> that in the Days of wicked <hi>Ahab,</hi> the whole People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſo Apoſtatiz'd from the true Religion, that <hi>Eliſha thought there was but himſelf left alone,</hi> who had not through the Influence of ſo many Idolatrous Examples, and the Power of that wicked Prince (together with the Corruption of their own Hearts, ſo prone to Idolatry) he thought there was

                     <hi>Not one man left in Iſrael, who had not bowed his knee to Baal.</hi> But he was never the more ſtagger'd for all that, but preſerv'd himſelf not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, a true Worſhiper of the True God. And for the Encouragement of you, who are Children and Servants, if it has been your Misfortune to be Born of wicked Parents, and Bred up in ungodly Families, conſider that <hi>There was found ſome good thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Lord God of Iſrael,</hi> for which God had a Regard to him, even in <hi>Abijah</hi> rhe Son of wicked <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.13. And <hi>Obadiah</hi> preſerv'd himſelf a good Man, even in the Houſe of wicked <hi>Ahab,</hi> Chap. 18.13. And ſo muſt you likewiſe, as you will approve your ſelves faithful Souldiers of Jeſus Chriſt, be wrought upon by no Examples to comply with Sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Nay, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front their bad Examples with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent One of his own.</note>Nay, Secondly, So far muſt a Chriſtian be from <hi>Conforming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> to the Examples of wicked Men, which would influence him to Sin, that he is call'd forth do more, Namely, to confront their bad Ones, with an extraordinary good One of his own; and in the midſt of an <hi>Evil and Adulterous Generation,</hi> he muſt ſhew himſelf an excellent Example of Religion and Vertue. Hence it is, that in the Fifth of St. <hi>Matth.</hi> of us Chriſtians it is ſaid, that we muſt be the <hi>Salt of the Earth,</hi> ver. 13. that we muſt be the <hi>Light of the World,</hi> and a <hi>City ſet on a Hill, that cannot be hid,</hi> and a <hi>Candle, not put under a Buſhel, but on a Candleſtick,</hi> ver. 14, 15. And laſtly, we are there commanded, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>To let our Light ſo ſhine before Men, that they may ſee our good Works, and glorify our Father which is in Heaven.</hi> It is therefore, that we are thus Repreſented, becauſe, that by the Excellency of our Examples, we muſt be as Salt to a corrupted World, to ſeaſon and recover it from its Corruption; that by the Eminency of all Chriſtian Vertues and Graces, ſhining in our Converſations, we muſt Enlighten the dark World; and lead 'em, by the Brightneſs of our good Examples, into Holineſs and Purity of Living. So much it lies upon you, not to Conform your ſelves to evil Examples, that would lead you into Sin, that by the Goodneſs of your own, you muſt draw others off from it.</p>

                        <hi>II.</hi> When they ſhall Tempt and Entice us by their evil Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</note>Secondly, <hi>You muſt refuſe to Conform your ſelves, as to the Examples, ſo to the Company of wicked Men, when falling amongſt 'em they would entice you to join with 'em in Sin.</hi> As there are a great many more of bad Examples abroad in the World, than good Ones: So the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection thereof is a great deal more taking, when a many of thoſe bad Men are met together in Company, than when they remain aſunder from one another.

Your lewd Companions indeed, as they are uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very buiſy in doing Miſchief, and corrupting others; and will wonderfully Triumph and Rejoice, when they have Perverted a Sober Perſon, and made him as bad as themſelves: So they are above all Induſtrious, to Corrupt and Enſnare Youth, that they may Propagate a Generation, as Wicked as they have been. And how will they Hug themſelves, when they have Debaucht an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Young Perſon, and made him at any time Drunk, or betray'd him into Lewdneſs, or any other Wickedneſs; eſpecially if of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing Hopes, and of ingenious Parts; and how many Wiles ſhall be us'd to Enſnare him again? <hi>Their Mouth is full of Deceit and Fraud, under their Tongue is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and Vanity, they lie lurking in the Thieviſh corners of the Streets, to wait for the Innocent, to draw him into their Net,</hi> Pſal. 10.7, 8, 9.</p>

They do uſually Enter him at firſt in your Taverns, and thoſe Places of Publick Entertainment, that are ſomething more remote from, and lie, as it were, only on the High-way to Sin.

And now if he has that Talent, which they call Wit, ſuch a ſhare at leaſt, as will enable him to talk Profanely, to break Jeſts upon Scripture, and, Oh Brutiſh Stupidity! Oh Deſperate Madneſs! To Blaſpheme, and fly into the Face of God Almighty; they feed his Vanity with loud Applauſes, and cry up to the Skies his Wit, and Parts.

                  <p>THAT which I am now upon is, to Forwarn you againſt the Temptations of the wicked World, by ſhewing you the dangerous Ones you ſhall meet withal, from the <hi>Wicked Men of the World, and in what Sence, and how far you muſt Renounce both them, and their wicked ways of Tempting others to Sin.</hi> This I have already done, as to their <hi>Evil Examples,</hi> and <hi>Evil Company,</hi> and have deliver'd theſe Inſtructions to you, that by God's Help may, I hope, be ſufficient to prevent your being infected by the Poiſon of either. But the wicked Men of the World, have other ways of Tempting Men to Sin, and what they are, and how bravely you muſt Reſiſt them, I am next to declare unto you.</p>

                        <hi>III.</hi> Flattery a great Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to Sin.</note>Thirdly, Then, amongſt the greateſt Temptations proceeding from Evil Men, we may deſervedly reckon their <hi>Flatteries.</hi> Now the Flatterer is One, who obſerving the general Self-love and Pride of Mankind, who cannot endure Reproof, or any thing that ſhews a Diſlike of what they ſay, or do, does compoſe himſelf to Admire and Extol, or at leaſt-wiſe to Approve, as Well-done, very bad Actions, or at beſt ſuch, as if Good in themſelves, are but indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently Perform'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Ground thereof our own immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Self-love</note>The Ground of his Flattery, I ſay, is <hi>That immoderate Self-love</hi> he obſerves Natural to moſt Men, whereby they do extravagantly eſteem and admire their own Performances, and can ſee no Defects therein: And therefore, whoever ſhall endeavour to diſcover their Faults, tho' in never ſo Prudent a manner, to any of theſe Self-admirers, he is preſently lookt upon as One, that either envies his Abilities and good Qualities, or as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was to the fooliſh <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians: He is therefore become his Enemy, becauſe he tells him the Truth,</hi> Gal. 4.16.</p>
                  <p>And now the Flatterer obſerving this predominant Humour in him, puts on the Vizard of a Friend, <hi>And compoſes himſelf to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and Extol, or at leaſt-wiſe to Approve, as Well-done, his very bad Actions, or at beſt ſuch, as if Good in themſelves, are very indifferently Perform'd.</hi> The Flatterer's care is to Pleaſe, not to Profit him, to whom he pretends to be a Friend, to make a Prey of the beſotted Self-admirer, and therefore ſooths him up in his Vices; he calls his
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:151517:178"/> Profaneneſs, Wit; ſhe that is Superſtitious, Devout; the Prodigal and Profuſe, he ſtiles Bountiful and Liberal; and the Covetous Worldling; from whom he expects an Eſtate, or Legacy, he Extolls to his Face, for his Prudence in managing his Affairs: The Oaths and Curſes, the Riot and Debaucheries of the wicked Crew he happens amongſt, he laughs at, as brave Exploits, and applauds them as the Standards of Wit and Bravery. And as to ſuch things, which are tolerably well Perform'd, but might be Better'd, for fear of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the <hi>Vanity of the Creature,</hi> whereby he might poſſibly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him, he diſcovers nothing of that, but <hi>All is well,</hi> and <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably Perform'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now this Flattery to the Vices and Imperfections of Men is of miſchievous Conſequence to 'em. So <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.28.<note place="margin">This Flattery keeping Men ignorant of the good or ill Qualities in 'em; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon</note> 
                     <hi>A flattering mouth worketh Ruine;</hi> and 29.5. <hi>A man that flattereth ſpreadeth a Net.</hi> For why? <q>The Flatterer, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerves, endeavours to make every Man his own Cheat, by keeping him ignorant of the good and ill Qualities, which are in him, whereupon the Good never come to Perfection, and the Ill grow Incorrigible.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this means, I ſay, <hi>The Good never come at Perfection.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Good never come to Perfection.</note> There is many a Perſon of a Generous Temper, who delights to do Good to Mankind, whoſe Head is working for the Publick, and loves to relieve the Needy; but all this 'tis viſible he does too much out of Oſtentation, and to get the Praiſe of Men, and ſo loſes his Reward from God: But now if he had but a faithful Monitor, that would fairly repreſent to him the Vanity and Affectation, that appears in the Good he does, and which others can ſee, tho' he himſelf is not ſenſible of. And that it is but to direct it to a right End, and then he will obtain a Reward in Heaven, and moreover merit the Praiſes of Men too: A little of this Sincerity and Freedom would make that Man an excellent Perſon, whom now his Vanity and Braging of the Good he does, renders Troubleſom and Hateful even to thoſe, whom he moſt Obliges. There is alſo many a One, who in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects concerning his own Advantage, and that of the Publick, out of an over-fond Conceit of his own Methods, diſdaining to ask Counſel; or if he did, they flattering every thing, and not ſincerely giving their Advice; the Deſign it ſelf therefore, and the meaſures of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it, tho' Good in the main, has for that very reaſon alone miſ-carry'd: So much does the Self-flattery of our own Hearts, join'd with the Flatteries of other Perſons, hinder our Good from arriving to Perfection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the Ill that is in Men does thereby grow Incorrigible.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">And the Ill that is in Men does thereby grow Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible.</note> Thus there is not a greater Cauſe at this Day of that Profaneneſs and Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Sin and Debauchery, than the Aſſentations, Smiles, and other Tokens of Approbation given by baſe Flattery, to horrid Wickedneſſes; whereas would every Chriſtian, as he is infinitely bound to do, expreſs his Diſlike, his Abhorrence, his Scorn of the Debauchees, and their Debaucheries, when they are openly Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or impudently Brag'd of, the impious Sinners of this Age would then endeavour to be Private however, not <hi>Affect,</hi> as they do, to be Publick in their Villanies. This baſe Flattery, of which there are but few, who are not Guilty, in not putting a Frown at leaſt-wiſe, inſtead of a Smile, upon Impious Doings, has tended
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:151517:179"/> extreamly to harden the Young Reprobates of our Age to their own, and the Nation's Ruine; for indeed, as the excellent <hi>Plutarch</hi> expreſſes it, <q>When Vice is extoll'd, ſo that a Man is induc'd to Sin, not only without Regret, but with Joy and Triumph, and is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned beyond the modeſty of a Bluſh for his Enormities: This ſort of Flattery has been fatal to whole Kingdoms.</q> And tho' indeed the Great Ones are moſt ſubject to it, becauſe they of all Men, will not endure Reproof; yet there are not any ſo mean, we ſee, whoſe Vices are not applauded amongſt their Companions, rather than Reprehended, and who are not therefore hardned thereby into all manner of Wickedneſs. In a word, It is this ſort of Flattery, which among all Ranks and Degrees of Men, <hi>Has ſtrengthened the hands of the Wicked, that he ſhould not return from his wicked way,</hi> Ezek. 13.22. So miſchievous a Temptation, you ſee, is Flattery; it hinders all ſorts of Perſons from improving their Vertues, and encourages 'em to the higheſt Pitch of wickedneſs. And now what muſt be done in this Caſe, that you may Effectually Renounce it, and avoid the ill Effects of it? And in order thereunto,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> In order to renounce flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery we muſt Caſhire eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vain Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of our own ſelves.</note>Firſt, Let me adviſe you, with the excellent Philoſopher now mention'd, that <q>
                        <hi>We Caſhire every vain Opinion of our ſelves, whoſe Inbred Flattery only diſpoſes and prepares us to a more favourable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of that from without:</hi> For he who loves to be Flatter'd, is doubtleſs ſufficiently fond of himſelf; and thro' abundance of Complaiſance to his own Perſon, not only wiſhes, but thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Maſter of all thoſe Perfections, which may recommend him to others. But did we reflect upon our own Nature and Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conſider what groſs Imperfections and Failures are mixt with our Words, Actions and Affections, we ſhould not lie ſo open to the Attempts of every Flatterer, who deſigns upon us;</q> and we ſhould be well prepar'd to Renounce and Reject all his deceitful Flatteries, which muſt be done: for</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> We muſt ſo far Renounce the Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Men, as to take it kindly to be Reproved.</note>Secondly, Having thus diſ-poſſeſt your Breaſts of an immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Self-love, you muſt <hi>So far renounce and reject the Flatteries of Men, as to take it kindly, when you are Reprov'd.</hi> And indeed you are to Eſteem and Love him, as your trueſt Friend, who deals ſo In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly with you, as frankly to diſcover to you your Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Failings of any Kind, and freely to Reprove you for your Faults. <hi>David</hi> deſired ſuch a Friend, who would thus Reprove him, Pſal. 141.5. <hi>Let the Righteous ſmite me, and it ſhall be a Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and let him Reprove me, and it ſhall be an excellent Oyl, which ſhall not break my Head;</hi> intimating, that the Flatteries of wicked Men, which in the other Tranſlation are call'd <hi>precious Balms,</hi> would mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wound him. And <hi>Solomon,</hi> who beſt knew what Wiſdom was, and the methods of Attaining it, does moſt frequently ſpeak of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, as a moſt excellent One, <hi>The Ear that heareth the Reproof of Life, abideth among the Wiſe; He that refuſeth Inſtruction, deſpiſeth his own Soul; but he that feareth Reproof, getteth <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> Prov. 15.31, 32. But on the contrary, to hate Reproof, is in his account the High-way to Error, Ruine and Deſtruction. Thus <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.17. <hi>He that refuſeth Reproof erreth.</hi> and 15.10. <hi>He that hateth Reproof ſhall dye.</hi> and 29.1. <hi>A man of Reproof, that hardneth his Neck, ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> This
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:151517:179"/> indeed, as any other Diſcipline is diſtaſtful to Fleſh and Blood, but it is in it ſelf the moſt profitable ſort of Correction, for <hi>A Reproof entereth more into a Wiſe man than Stripes,</hi> Prov. 17.10.</p>
                  <p>And as you muſt bring your ſelf to that humble and low Opinion of your own Perfections, and to that ſenſe of your Faults,<note place="margin">Eſpecially the Reproofs of God's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are to be kindly receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</note> as to take kindly the Reproof of a Friend, and to amend upon it; ſo eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally you are to receive, with all Reverence, and Reſpect, and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Reproofs of God's Miniſters, tending either to better, or reform you. Of all Men living it muſt not be expected from us, to favour you in any thing amiſs, to ſmile upon your Extravagancies, to ſpeak only Comforts and Conſolations to you, when we come to deal with your Conſciences, which ought to be ſearcht to the Bottom by us, and the Corruption let out. This was that Flattery which <hi>Jeremiah</hi> reprehends, and ſeverely threatens in the Prophets and Prieſts of his Time, 6.13, 14, 15. But our Buſineſs is by Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Catechizing, and all the Methods of Inſtruction, to give you a through Underſtanding of all the Terms and Conditions of that Covenant, wherein you ſtand Engag'd to God; to be Watchmen over your Souls, in order to diſcover your Errors and Failures there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; to direct you for your better Improvement in thoſe Graces, whereunto you have already attain'd; and you muſt expect it from us, to frown upon your Follies, and boldly to Reprove you, when we perceive you to Tranſgreſs our Great Maſter's Laws. And you muſt receive all this at our Hands, not only as a neceſſary Diſcharge of our Duty, but what you muſt apply to your own Improvement and Reformation. And this if you ſhould not do, your Ruine will be imputed to it. Hence <hi>Solomon</hi> warns the Young-man to beware of ſinful Extravagancies, <hi>Leſt he be brought to Mourn at the laſt, when his Fleſh and his Bones are conſum'd,</hi> and to own as the cauſe of all this, <hi>That he hated Inſtruction, and that his Heart deſpiſed Reproof, that he obey'd not the Voice of his Teachers, nor inclined his Ear to them, that Inſtructed him,</hi> Prov. 5.11, 12, 13. So far therefore is the Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of wicked Men to be Renounced, that Reproof on the contrary is to be Kindly receiv'd. But</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Wicked Men will proceed farther to Tempt others to Sin, even <hi>By their falſe and fallacious Argueings againſt the Neceſſity of a Holy Life.</hi>

                        <hi>IV.</hi> Wicked Men Tempt others to Sin by their falſe and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Neceſſity of a Holy Life.</note> One would think there ſhould be none profeſſing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, that ſhould openly Plead for Sin; but yet ſuch Factors and Agents Satan has amongſt us, as will openly Avow his Cauſe, and will endeavour to Perſwade you, that you are not Obliged to that Strictneſs of Living, which we Preachers are continually ſounding in Men's Ears.</p>
                  <p>And to this Purpoſe you ſhall hear them Argue ſo hotly, that God no doubt is a Merciful Being, and will not ſurely for the Sins of a ſhort Life, Condemn the Guilty to an Eternity of Woe and Miſery. And as to the Duties of Religion, you ſhall hear 'em argue, that they are hard Sayings, and who can bear 'em. And as to themſelves, you ſhall hear theſe Men often Pleading, that they are made of Fleſh and Blood, and therefore ſure God will not require Men, upon the Hazard of Salvation, to mortify the Fleſh; and that they are ſet in a World full of Temptations, and abounding in Delights and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and that therefore God, who has Plac'd 'em in it, will not
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:151517:180"/> command 'em upon Pain of Damnation, to Overcome theſe ſtrong Temptations, and to deny theſe Pleaſures of the World.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the common, and pernicious, and licentious Argueings of Men, to perſwade both themſelves and others into ſuch eaſy Notions of God and Religion, that they may Sin with more Security, and leſs Fear. And this has been a powerful Art in all times; and ſuch Arguments as theſe Men are moſt ready to Believe, becauſe they love the Thing they Plead for, becauſe they favour their Luſts, and grant 'em ſo much Liberty in what they long for, the ſatisfying the Fleſh, and enjoying the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">All which wicked Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings we muſt fortify our ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt; as when they Plead,</note>But do you beware, and fortify your ſelves well againſt thoſe falſe Argueings of Sinful men, in Behalf of their Luſts, and againſt the Strictneſs of Religion, whereby they would Perſwade you, as well as themſelves, into a ſinful Security, and with-draw you from, or ſlacken you in your Duty. They are <hi>falſe and fallacious Arguments,</hi> that would perſwade us to Comply in the leaſt with Sin, for there is nothing more plain in Scripture, than that Sin muſt with all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Care be avoided. It tells us poſitively, <hi>That we muſt deny all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and worldly Luſts, and live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent World,</hi> Tim. 2.12. <hi>And that all that name the Name of Chriſt, muſt depart from Iniquity,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19. And that all true Chriſtians muſt be <hi>Cleanſed from all filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit, and perfect Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the fear of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. And in order to Perfection, that they muſt <hi>Cut off right Hands, and put out right Eyes, when they offend 'em;</hi> that is, any Luſts that are ſo dear and uſeful to you, as theſe Members are, <hi>Matth.</hi> 29.30. What ſhall I ſay? It tells us, that the <hi>Friendſhip of the world is Enmity againſt God, and that whoſoever will be a Friend of the world, is an Enemy of God,</hi> Jam. 4.4. And then as for the Puniſhment of Sin, there is not One but has the Penalty of Eternal Death and Miſery, if Unrepented of, affixt to it. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. it is ſaid, that <hi>the Fearful,</hi> or thoſe who Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize from the Faith out of fear, <hi>and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelieving, and the Abominable, and Murderers, and Whore-mongers, and Sorcerers, and Idolaters, and all Liars, ſhall have their part in the Lake, which burneth with Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone; which is the ſecond death.</hi> This the Word of God does aſſure us, and then for Men to raiſe to themſelves Hopes of Impunity, ſo contrary to the expreſs Declarations of Scripture, when if they ſhall be miſtaken, and find after all, God's Threatnings to prove real, (as there is infinite Reaſon to believe they ſhall) this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the moſt deſperate Preſumption in the World.</p>
                  <p>But if you conſider theſe Arguments aſunder, there is no ſtrength in 'em, wherefore any ſhould venture to rely upon 'em. <hi>For in the firſt place, it is in no wiſe Inconſiſtent with God's Mercy, for the Sins of a ſhort Life, to Condemn the Guilty to an Eternity of Woe and Miſery.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> That it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> God's Mercy for the Sins of a ſhort life to Condemn the Guilty to an Eternity of Woe and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</note> His Mercy is ſufficiently ſatisfied in laying no Tyrannical Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions upon us, as Satan and all falſe Gods have done upon their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Votaries. It is yet a farther Demonſtration of his Mercy, that our vertuous Performances, tho' they are their own Reward here, yet they ſhall be alſo abundantly Recompenced hereafter. He does moreover let us ſee his Mercy in his long Forbearance of us, notwithſtanding, that by our numberleſs Provocations, we do <hi>Grieve his Holy Spirit.</hi> But he has given us the greateſt Diſcoveries of his
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:151517:180"/> Mercy, beyond what could ever enter into the Hearts of Men to expect, when he gave his own Son to be an <hi>Atonement and Expiation</hi> for our Sins, that his Juſtice might not proceed againſt us; and when he ſent him to us with a Covenant of Grace, as an Act of Pardon, propoſing to us, not only a perfect Reconciliation with our offended God, but infinite Rewards in Heaven, if we would return to our due Obedience, and Pay him no other but a reaſonable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. I think this is ſufficient for Mercy to do; and if ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurable Mercies will not win upon us, it is time that as ſevere a Juſtice ſhould then take place; for we are to conſider God as the ſupreme Governour of Men, and Juſtice is as neceſſary an Attribute in Government, as Mercy.</p>
                  <p>Nor is his Severity, in Puniſhing the Sins of a ſhort Life, with an Eternity of Woe and Miſery, but what is agreeable to his Juſtice and Wiſdom, as ſupreme Governour of the World. It is neceſſary in all Governments, that the Laws thereof ſhould be enforc'd with ſuch Penalties, as ſhall be ſufficient to deter People from the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of thoſe Laws. And therefore the Penalties being future, it is neceſſary they ſhould be vaſtly Great, to Over-balance the Profits, or Pleaſures of Sin, which are preſent. It may ſeem hard indeed at firſt ſight, in Humane Governments, that a Perſon for Clipping a Peice of Silver, which bears the <hi>Image and Superſcription of Caeſar,</hi> or for Stealing it from another, ſhould forfeit not only his Good and Chattels, but alſo his Life it ſelf; but yet ſince upon the Temptations of preſent Profit, bad Men will adventure to commit ſuch Facts, and the Authority of Laws cannot otherwiſe be kept up, nor Men's Rights and Properties preſerv'd: It is not thought by the Honeſt Part of Mankind, Inconſiſtent with the Wiſdom and Juſtice of Governours, to inflict even ſuch Puniſhments, as extend to the loſs of Life. It is theſe alone are ſufficient to Out-weigh the preſent Conſideration of Profit to the Offender, and effectually to move him to live in Obedience to Government; and therefore theſe, as great as they be, are eſteem'd but Juſt and Equal. So here in the Government of God over us: The Pleaſures and Profits of Sin, to compaſs which, Men will Tranſgreſs the Laws of Heaven, are but ſhort, true it is; but yet being preſent, and the Puniſhments Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd to 'em being apprehended, by moſt Sinners, to be at a great diſtance, they are therefore generally prevailing, and Men for that Reaſon do venture to Tranſgreſs the Laws of God, (a Thing of worſe Conſequence than the Violation of Humane Ordinances;) and therefore it is no other, than what can be expected from the Juſtice and Wiſdom of the ſupreme Governour of the World, to inflict ſuch infinite and eternal Puniſhments. In ſhort, Divine Vengeance, as well as Humane, muſt be ſuch as will Over-balance the Reaſons and Motives to Sin. And the Pleaſures and Profits of Sin being preſent, and the Divine Puniſhments not taking place but in another World, according to the Fundamental Rules and Reaſons of Government, they muſt be Infinite and Eternal, and all little enough, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they will not be ſufficient to ſecure our Obedience to the Laws of Heaven. So that there is no Strength in this Argument of Sinful Men, againſt the Juſtice of Eternal Torments, in the behalf of their Luſts, whereby they would perſwade you, as well as themſelves,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:151517:181"/> into a moſt dangerous Security, and withdraw you from, or ſlacken you in your Duty.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Nor are the Duties of our Religion hard Sayings, which no Man can bear,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> That the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are hard ſayings which no Man can bear.</note> as they will likewiſe plead. All the Duties enjoin'd us in the Goſpel, reſpect either God, our Neighbour, or our Selves. Thoſe to God, as we find 'em laid down <hi>in pure and undefiled Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> (undefiled, I ſay, with the Inventions of Men) are no ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, ſenſeleſs, and uncouth Obſervances, ſo much the matter of all other Worſhips beſides the Chriſtian; but are all of 'em indeed, a moſt <hi>Reaſonable Service.</hi> Thoſe which reſpect our Neighbour, are no other than Acts of Juſtice, Peace, and Charity, the contrary of which would deſtroy Humane Society, or make us Beaſts of Prey one to another. And as to thoſe Duties we owe to our ſelves, why, they are no other than, that we ſhould truly and <hi>juſtly value our ſelves,</hi> neither <hi>overmuch</hi> by Pride, nor <hi>too little</hi> by letting baſe Luſts to reign over us, or the inferiour part of our Nature, to Domineer it over our Reaſon and Underſtanding, the Superiour, and in all Equity the Governing Part of us. And what is there hard in all this that we ſhould quarrel with our Duty, except we count it hard, that God, who has made us reaſonable Creatures, would not ſuffer us to Transform our ſelves into unreaſonable Brutes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, And this is a ſufficient Anſwer alſo, to that other Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſinful Men, <hi>That they are made of Fleſh and Blood, and therefore ſure God will not require Men, upon the Forfeiture of Salvation, if they do not, to mortify the Fleſh.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>III.</hi> That they are made of Fleſh and Blood, and that therefore ſure God will not require Men, upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, if they do not, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the fleſh.</note> For theſe Men, who Plead thus, ought to conſider, that they conſiſt of Soul and Spirit, as well as of Fleſh and Blood; and as the Soul is Superiour, and the Governing Part within us; ſo it is highly reaſonable it ſhould have the Obedience of the Other: And this is all the <hi>Mortification,</hi> which Religion puts the Fleſh to. It would keep it in Subjection to the Dictates of Right Reaſon, and that is all. And tho' this Mortification of the Fleſh is to be exercis'd, by Impoſing ſome Severities ſometimes upon the Body, as by Faſting and Watching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet this is no more to be complain'd of, than that Refractory Children, and Servants, and Subjects muſt be ſometimes kept up under Diſcipline, as there ſhall be occaſion.</p>
                  <p>Nay, but Laſtly, ſay theſe Men, <hi>God has ſet us in a World full of Temptations, and abounding with ſenſual Delights and Pleaſures; and he therefore, who has Plac'd us in it, ſure will not command us upon Pain of Damnation, to Overcome thoſe ſtrong Temptations, and to Deny theſe Pleaſures of the World.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Laſtly, that God has ſet us in a World full of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and abounding with ſenſual Delights and Pleaſures; and that he therefore who has placed us in it, will not command us, upon Pain of Damnation, to over-come thoſe ſtrong Temptations, and to deny theſe Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the World.</note> And we'll grant it, that he has Plac'd us in a State of Probation and Trial, where we have ſenſual Pleaſures and Delights, and many other Temptations, beſetting us on the one ſide, as well as the Rewards of Heaven, awaiting us on the other; and where were the Vertue, and what Place would there be for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, if there were not thoſe Difficulties to overcome? But in ſhort, there is not any thing Unreaſonable, nor a Hardſhip unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable in any thing, that God has Enjoin'd us; for the ſame Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Goodneſs, which gives us the Command to do theſe things, gives us alſo the Will and Power to Obey, and beſides propoſes to us Enjoyments infinitely ſurpaſſing thoſe Worldly Pleaſures, as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of ſuch Obedience. And ſo I have given you ſufficient An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:151517:181"/> to thoſe falſe and fallacious Argueings of ſinful Men, againſt the Neceſſity of a Holy Life, I know 'em to be too common in the Diſcourſes of ſuch Perſons, who love their Luſts, and therefore I thought it requiſite to fortify you againſt them.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, Fifthly, Wicked Men will not be content by the ſecret Influence of their Examples and Company only, nor by their falſe and fallacious Arguments to Tempt you to Sin, but <hi>Will moreover ſometimes add Kindneſſes and Promiſes to oblige you to do ill Things, and on the contrary will much diſcourage you, nay ſometimes Threaten you, to forbear your Duty.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>V.</hi> Wicked Men will add Kindneſſes &amp; Promiſes to Oblige us to do ill Things, and on the contrary will much diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us, nay ſometimes Threaten us to forbear our Duty.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Kindneſſes of Friendſhip are of all things the moſt Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and if your Choice of a Friend has not been ſo diſcreetly and happily made, but he happens to be a wicked Man, who upon the Score of former Obligations laid upon you, will require in Return, that ſome ill Thing ſhould be done by you to ſerve his Intereſt, you will be drawn thereby into a very great Snare; for beſides that, there is in very many, whom we call Good-natur'd Men, ſuch an Eaſineſs of Mind, that they can hardly deny any thing to thoſe, who have once Oblig'd 'em; but are ready to Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Comply with 'em, tho' in things moſt directly contrary to their own Minds and Inclination. Beſides this, if you ſhould refuſe to Gratify in any thing, One that has done you former Kindneſſes, the World will be ready to call you <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngrateful,</hi> the moſt odious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, that can be caſt on any One.</p>
                  <p>Nay, and wicked Men will not ſometimes ſtick to <hi>Bribe you alſo with Promiſes and Propoſals of Profit and Advantages, if you will ſerve 'em in their ill Deſigns.</hi> This One would think not ſo dangerous a Temptation to Sin, becauſe more open, and not ſo Inſinuating a way as the former; but God knows, too many do knowingly and wilfully barter away their poor Souls, and plainly ſell 'em to the Devil, contracting to commit this, or that Sin; as for Inſtance, to take a falſe Oath, to forge Writings, to make a Lie in another's behalf, upon the Promiſe, or Intimation of ſome Reward for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thus will wicked Men, ſome by Kindneſſes, ſome by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, Oblige you, if they can, to ſerve 'em by your Sins.</p>
                  <p>And ſome on the other hand will be no leſs Induſtrious by <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements,</hi> nay <hi>Threatnings</hi> to hinder you in the diſcharging your Duty, and a good Conſcience. Religion will ſometimes put you upon doing thoſe things, that will Prejudice your worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, and ſtir up the Wrath of thoſe, that are Superiour to you. And indeed in this Caſe, a <hi>Man's worſt Enemies ſhall be thoſe of his own Houſe;</hi> and when either you muſt Sin, or Suffer, none will be ſo forward to Tempt you to Sin, rather than to Suffer, as your neareſt Relations and Acquaintance: And what muſt Wife, and Children, and Family do, if you ſhould talk of Forſaking all, and of following Chriſt in the Preſervation of a good Conſcience, will be the Argument, that the Friend of your own Boſom will ſtrongly urge you withal.</p>
                  <p>But the more common Temptation diſcouraging Men in the Diſcharge of their Duty, eſpecially ſuch as are of a low Rank and Condition in the World, are the Frowns and Threats of thoſe, that are above 'em. Hence a Miniſter in low Circumſtances, ſhall
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:151517:182"/> venture hard, if he offers to Reprove a Great Man, tho' a Great Sinner. And you ſhall ſcarcely ever know an Officer, tho' never ſo ſtrictly oblig'd thereunto by his Oath, preſent, in order to Puniſhment, the Man of Power and Intereſt in his Pariſh, for his Oaths, his Riots, and the moſt outragious Immoralities, which he ſo ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalouſly commits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> Kindneſſes muſt not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt us to Sin.</note>And now what ſhall be done, with reference to theſe manifold Encouragemetns to Sin, and Diſcouragements to Vertue, which you ſhall meet withal from wicked Men? Why, in the firſt Place, have a ſpecial Care you be not Inveigled by the pretended Kindneſs of any Perſon, be he who, or what he will. Let not the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of your Friend, or Acquaintance cauſe you to ſtrain Truth, when you are call'd to give Teſtimony in his Cauſe. Take care you be not then wrought upon by any Sence of Kindneſs to Perjure your ſelves for him, by declaring either more than Truth, or by ſpeaking not the whole Truth, when it would make againſt him. Conſider what Kindneſs has been done you, if you muſt ſin againſt God, and your own Soul, to Pleaſure your Friend in Return for it; It was but a Bait to take you, a Snare to Entrap you, and a pleaſant Poiſon given to deſtroy you. <q>You ought indeed, as an honeſt Pagan ſays excellently well, to be aſſiſtant to him in his honeſt Endeavours, but not in his Knaveries; in his Counſels, not in his Tricks; in appearing as Evidence for him, but not in a Cheat; and you muſt bear a Share in the misfortunes of your Friend, but not in his Acts of Injuſtice.</q>

                        <hi>II.</hi> Promiſes muſt not bribe us.</note>Secondly, As to any Promiſes, wherewith wicked Men may ſo Tempt you, as to Hire you to Sin, God forbid, there ſhould be a Neceſſity to bid you Reject and Deteſt them. But if there be any need to Fortify any here againſt ſuch a Temptation, the meer Fooliſhneſs of the Bargain you will make, will ſufficiently move you to ſpurn at them; for if it be an <hi>unprofitable,</hi> a very unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Bargain, tho' a Man ſhould <hi>Gain the whole World, and loſe his own Soul,</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.36.

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Nor, Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, muſt Threatnings, or Frowns fright us from it.</note>Nor Laſtly muſt a Souldier of Jeſus Chriſt be frighted out of the way of his Duty, or aw'd into any ſinful, or ſlaviſh Compliance, by the <hi>Threats and Frowns of any Man living:</hi> Shrink not from the Exerciſe of Religion and Uprightneſs, becauſe many about you, and they perhaps Above, or Richer than you, are profane and lewd, and utterly regardleſs of any thing that is Good, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over do Diſcourage and Affront it. For this if you ſhould, you will moſt certainly offend your Great Lord and Maſter, the Lord of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:151517:182"/> Heaven and Earth, and who has call'd upon you, not to fear a mortal Man; no, tho' he could <hi>Kill the Body, but to be afraid</hi> of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing him rather, <hi>who is able to deſtroy both Body and Soul in Hell; Yea, I ſay unto you, fear him,</hi> Luk. 12.4.</p>
                  <p>And now, Laſtly, I cannot call to Mind any other Temptations,<note place="margin">Laſtly, the evil Cuſtoms which have prevailed in the World, are a powerful Temptation to Sin.</note> uſual amongſt wicked Men, to Tempt others to Sin, beſides <hi>ſome Evil Cuſtoms ſo rife amongſt many.</hi> That the Heathen Idolatries, and thoſe filthy Practices, committed in 'em, were ſo univerſally Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with, by all ſorts of Men in the Pagan World, was, becauſe they were Commended and Eſtabliſhed by Publick Cuſtom. Many of their wiſeſt Men and Philoſophers, had other Conceptions of God, than to think it was fit, to <hi>Change the Glory of God into the Similitude of an Ox, that eateth Graſs;</hi> and thought alſo, he ought to be Worſhipt, not by Fooleries and Impurities, but with a chaſt Mind and a clean Heart. And yet even thoſe Men ſubmitted to <hi>Common Cuſtom,</hi> and whatever they thought, or ſpoke Privately amongſt themſelves, they acted and ſpoke in Publick, as the reſt did. And it was to the Prevalency of Cuſtom, that the Apoſtle imputed thoſe Enormities of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> before their Converſion, telling 'em, that <hi>In time paſt they walked according to the Courſe of this World,</hi> Eph. 2.2. And indeed ſo great is the Power of Evil Cuſtom, that it does ſtill, amongſt Chriſtians, conſtrain Perſons to do many ill Things, even contrary to their Natures and Inclinations, as well as Religion.

                  <p>Cuſtom, I ſay, does ſtill amongſt Chriſtians, conſtrain Perſons to do many ill Things, even contrary to their Nature and Inclinations, as well as Religion. Hence among the <hi>Men of Honour,</hi> as they would be thought, ſhall many become even Self-murderers, meerly in Compliance with Cuſtom; inſomuch, that thoſe Perſons, who of all Men living, have moſt reaſon to preſerve their Lives, having all their good Things they can ever expect, in this World, yet deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately ſpill one another's Blood in your curſed Duels. It is no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination in theſe Men, I dare ſay, to be ſo Prodigal of their dear Lives, that makes 'em ſo deſperately throw 'em away; but meerly out of a <hi>Cowardly Fear,</hi> they ſhould be branded with Diſgrace, for not complying with ſo common a Cuſtom, amongſt Perſons of their own Character. So again, among Perſons of all Ranks, you ſhall have Men of no manner of Inclinations to intemperate Drinking, yet when they come to any Great Man's Houſe, where it is the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and Brutiſh Cuſtom of <hi>Drinking Men hard:</hi> Yet at ſuch times they will not ſcruple to Exceed very far.

Hence do Multitudes make not the leaſt ſcruple of Abſenting, their whole Lives, from the Bleſſed Sacrament, becauſe it is ſo common amongſt many to do ſo. Thus powerful, you ſee, are the Evil Cuſtoms of the World, ſo as almoſt to force Men, whether they will or no, to do many ill things; and what is worſe, to ſeare their Conſciences in the Commiſſion of the worſt Sins, and in the Omiſſion of the chiefeſt Duties.</p>

                     <note place="margin">A Chriſtian muſt coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly and vigorouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and withſtand the Force of all ſinful Cuſtoms whatſoever.</note>And now, what muſt a Chriſtian do in this Caſe? Cuſtom we know is a <hi>Second Nature,</hi> and when it has been of a long Date, <hi>Time out of Mind,</hi> as the Phraſe is, <hi>it pleads Preſcription,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Force of a Law amongſt Men. So that be a Cuſtom never ſo contrary to Honeſty, Sobriety, to common Sence and Reaſon, or any the Laws of Chriſtianity, an old Cuſtom muſt not be broken; it is the Cuſtom of the Place, and muſt be kept up: Such are the Sentiments of the Vulgar in this matter. But you muſt reſolve with all Courage and Stedfaſtneſs, like true Souldiers of Jeſus Chriſt, to <hi>Renounce</hi> and <hi>Withſtand</hi> the Force of all ſinful Cuſtoms whatſoever, and not to ſuffer your ſelves to be over-born thereby into any ſinful Compliances.</p>
                  <p>When Chriſtianity was firſt Preach'd amongſt Men, ſuch barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and brutiſh Cuſtoms had of a long time prevail'd over the greateſt Part of the Heathen World, that many Practices which the meer Light of Nature would teach Men to Abandon, as Sins and Wounds of Conſcience, <q>Were, as the Learned Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> obſerves, Embrac'd by whole Nations at once, and continued in without any Check, as innocent, ſinleſs Qualities, Nature and Reaſon being ſo early engag'd, and ſilenc'd by popular Cuſtom, and vicious Education, that many knew it not to be a Sin to Steal, or Rob, if they were ſo cunning, as not to be taken; others to Kill, and Eat their Aged Parents (conceiving that by this means they gave 'em a more Honourable Burial;) others to throw themſelves murderouſly into the Flames, to accompany their Dead Princes out of the World. Many the like irrational Sins, through ſome local Cuſtoms got the Reputation, not only of ſinleſs and lawful, but of laudable alſo.</q> But all who Embrac'd Chriſtianity, as they were obliged by their Baptiſmal Vow, to forſake thoſe and the like Heatheniſh Cuſtoms, (for to ſuch this Vow did particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly relate) ſo they did preſently beat them down wherever the Chriſtian Religion prevail'd, inſomuch that in few Ages, there were not the leaſt Footſteps thereof remaining. And ſo muſt you likewiſe vigorouſly withſtand all Cuſtoms that are <hi>Immoral,</hi> wherever, and by whomſoever, and how long ſoever they have obtain'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Such only as are Immoral are to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.</note>I do ſay, All Cuſtoms that are <hi>Immoral:</hi> For I do not mean, that a Chriſtian muſt turn Cynick, a dogged and ſower Lump of Earth, ſurly, and uncivil, and quarrelling with the innocent Modes of Humane Society. That is as much a Fault on the other ſide, to think that Chriſtianity, the calmeſt and the ſweeteſt Religion in the World, does oblige Men to ill Manners. But thoſe Cuſtoms, the Force of whoſe Temptations I would have you all to Reſiſt,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:151517:183"/> and utterly to Renounce, are ſuch as I before mention'd, and which are apparently ſinful and wicked, either tending to leſſen the Guilt of Sin, or to make it none at all.</p>
                  <p>I am ſenſible there is ſomething of Difficulty in this Part of our Warfare above any other. Barely to refuſe Compliance with, but much more to oppoſe Evil Men in their ſinful Cuſtoms and and Practices, will mightily provoke their Indignation. He ſails a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Wind that does ſo, and ſwims againſt the Stream. He ſhall have Multitudes will thwart him, and will load him with hard Reproaches; will call him ſingular and preciſe Fool for his Pains, and what not? He muſt have a great deal of Courage that oppoſes a Multitude in doing Evil, or will not comply with 'em in it. But ſuch muſt the Souldier of Jeſus Chriſt be, One that dares Incur the greateſt Diſpleaſure, rather than ſhrink from his Duty; and One that will not be afraid to ſhew his Diſlike of any vicious Cuſtoms, when there is juſt Occaſion for it.</p>
                  <p>And this indeed is true <hi>Courage,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The greateſt Courage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to this Part of a Chriſtian's Warfare.</note> to deſpiſe all Oppoſition in the way of Duty, and he that can Unconcernedly paſs through a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, Reproaching and Vilifying him for his Pains, in Purſuit of Vertue, is more Heroick and Brave, than he that with his Sword in his Hand cuts open a way to the Taking of a Fort. He that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves a Sin, or Renounces an Ungodly Cuſtom, may have more of true Fortitude, than he that Puſhes on through drawn Swords, for it is a ſign he fears not thoſe Weapons which wound deepeſt, an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter'd and envenom'd Tongue.</p>
                  <p>It is plain beyond all Contradiction, I do think,<note place="margin">Cowardice the Cauſe of Complying with the Cuſtome of Duelling, or any other Cuſtome of Sinning.</note> that when Men in Oppoſition to their Inclination, and Reaſon, and Religion dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the contrary, do comply with others in Drinking of Healths to Exceſs, in profane or looſe Talk, or the like: It is plain, I ſay, that it is out of fear of Reproaches, and for want of Courage, that Men do thus Sin. Nay, I dare be bold to affirm, however like a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox it may appear to ſome, That it is out of Fear, and for want of true Courage, that Men fight Duels, when they are Provokt, or Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted. They are afraid, that if in Compliance to our Saviour's Doctrines of Meekneſs, Patience and Forbearance, they ſhould put up Affronts, they would be Reproacht and Scorn'd by the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and be term'd Cowards, and therefore do deſperately (but enough againſt their ſecret Inclinations, I dare ſay) betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to this Barbarous and Fool-hardy way of ſhewing themſelves Men of Honour.</p>
                  <p>But true Courage and Bravery, Philoſophy, and Religion, and the ſober Reaſon of all wiſe Men tell us, will deſpiſe the vain Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Unthinking and Impious Croud, which, for the moſt part, are in the wrong; and will ſteddily purſue what is Vertuous, and Fit, and Reaſonable, and Religious, notwithſtanding the fooliſh Reproaches of the Many. So that to retain One's Integrity and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and an unpolluted Conſcience, in the midſt of common and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Cuſtoms of Sin and Vice, I dare be bold to aſſert, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt and moſt Heroick piece of Courage.</p>
                  <p>And accordingly it will be Rewarded with a Noble Teſtimony by our Bleſſed Saviour, when to have his Teſtimony will be beyond the Applauſes of the whole World. To Renounce and Oppoſe the Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:151517:184"/> and Profane Cuſtoms of wicked Men, is an eminent Piece of Chriſtian Confeſſion, and <hi>He who Confeſſes him before Men, the ſame will the Son of Man Confeſs,</hi> Own as his faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and Applaud as a Noble Confeſſor, <hi>before the Angels of God,</hi> Luke 12.8.</p>
                  <p>And let this ſuffice, to have ſpoken concerning the wicked Men of the World, that you muſt ſo far Renounce both them, and their wicked ways, as <hi>Never to become Tempters your ſelves of others to Sin, nor to yield your ſelves a Prey to other Men's Temptations,</hi> but muſt ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly refuſe Conformity to them, and all their ways, whereby they would have you Offend God, and Violate your Covenant with him, and your Vows in Baptiſm, and thereby forfeit all your Title, and Hopes of Happineſs.</p>

                  <p>HAVING fully Survey'd the <hi>World,</hi> and all therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, that is fit to be Renounced by every Chriſtian: And having alſo Repreſented to you thoſe Temptations, which are given by the <hi>wicked World,</hi> and how we muſt <hi>Reſiſt</hi> them; I come now to explain unto you, what is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the <hi>Pomps and Vanity of this wicked World,</hi> and to ſhew you, how much it behoves Chriſtians to Renounce, and to Deſpiſe them.

                  <p>And, Firſt, As to <hi>Pomps,</hi> theſe as they were part of the Pagan Idolatries: So they were what the Primitive Chriſtians were more particularly concern'd to Renounce. But however, ſince the ſame Renunciation of the Pomps of this World, is ſtill retain'd in our Church, tho' the very ſame things, which were at firſt meant thereby, are perhaps become Obſolete, and out of Uſe in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: And yet it is not to be ſuppos'd, but that our Church had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſomething ſtill in Uſe in the Chriſtian World, as fit to be Renounc'd, under that Title, by every Diſciple of JESUS: I ſhall therefore, together with a ſhort Account of the Meaning of Pomps, in the Sence they were Renounc'd by the Primitive Chriſtians, take care, eſpecially to ſhew you, what amongſt us is moſt Analogous to the ancient Heatheniſh <hi>Pomps,</hi> and bears ſuch a near Reſemblance to 'em, as to render theſe, our modern <hi>Pomps,</hi> fit alſo to be <hi>Renounc'd</hi> by every Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>And, Firſt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> Thereby were ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meant thoſe pompous Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles, Plays, and Scenical Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons exhibited in the Roman Theaters.</note> By Pomps were anciently meant (in the Opinion of our Learned and Excellent Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>) thoſe Pompous Shews and Spectacles exhibited by the Emperors, and Great Men of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Roman Theaters, wherein Multitudes of Captive Wretches were put to ſlay one another in their Sword-Plays, for the Diverſion of the People. And indeed it is not unlikely, that thereby may be meant, not only thoſe Bloody Sword-Plays, but all thoſe <hi>Scenical Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Plays</hi> whatever, acted in Memory of their falſe Gods, upon their Great Feſtivals, which were ſometimes ſo very Lewd and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, (for Inſtance, thoſe which were acted in Honour of <hi>Flora</hi>) that the People of <hi>Rome</hi> were aſham'd to proceed in 'em,<note place="margin">

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:151517:185"/> and the Scenes Magnificent, the greateſt Grandees of <hi>Rome</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at 'em, and having their proper Seats, or <hi>Boxes,</hi> appropriated to each Order and Rank of Great Men, according to their Degrees and Qualities. And here alſo very likely it was, that the Lewd Crew of both Sexes met together to make their Aſſignations; for near to the <hi>Circus</hi> and <hi>Theater,</hi> there were thoſe Stews, where they withdrew to act their vile Abominations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Our Modern Plays no leſs Inferior to 'em in Impiety, than in Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſneſs.</note>And now, that which Approaches in theſe our Days, neareſt to thoſe ſort of Heatheniſh Pomps, and which in Pompouſneſs and Magnificence of Scene, are not much Inferiour to them, are thoſe Profane and Lewd Plays, Acted in our Publick Play-houſes, where, for ought I know, more Souls are now Murder'd, than in the former were Bodies; more Profaneneſs utter'd, and more Lewd Aſſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made, than at the Pagan Theaters: And how infinitely unfit then is it, that thoſe kind of Diverſions ſhould be ſuffer'd in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian State, or that Perſons, profeſſing Chriſtianity, ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to go near 'em? The Primitive Fathers lookt upon the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Play-houſes, as no other than the Devil's Territories, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that it happening once, that when a Chriſtian being prompted by Curioſity, to be preſent at the Spectacles therein, was poſſeſt by the Devil, the Father was not at all Startle'd at it, but readily own'd, that Satan had a Right to take that Perſon Captive, whom he found within his own Precincts.

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">And having ſuch a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Influence upon Faith, and Manners, ought never to be frequented by Chriſtians.</note>And now, ſince it is Univerſally agreed amongſt all ſerious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that a more Irreligious Spirit did never Reign upon any Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than has in this laſt Age in our Modern Play-houſes: <q>Since (as is the general Complaint) in theſe Houſes Piety is ſo ſtrangely Ridicul'd, the Holy and Reverend Name of God Profan'd, and his Glory and Intereſt render'd ſo Contemptible and Vile: Since the Youth eſpecially of our Nation, are ſo allur'd hereby into the Love of, and Delight in Idleneſs, exceſſive Vanity, Revelings, Luxury, Wantonneſs, Laſciviouſneſs, Whoredoms, and ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries by Oaths, Looſeneſs of Converſation, and corrupt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtical Principles: Since our Gentlemen are here taught to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride Religion, to Diſſolve in Luxury, to Abandon themſelves to their Pleaſures, to be Debauchers of Women, to be Profuſe and Extravagant in their Expences, and to be entirely Libertines: Since the Young Ladies of our Nation, are here throughly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in Intrigues and Aſſignations, to Scoff at the prudent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedneſs and Modeſty of the beſt of their Sex, to deſpiſe the wiſe Inſtructions of their Parents and Guardians, to be Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to their Authority, and at laſt, without their Knowledge, or Conſent, to Marry themſelves to ſome looſe, or lewd Libertine: And indeed ſince the Minds and Manners of the Great Ones eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, of both Sexes, are thereby ſo foully Corrupted, and their
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:151517:185"/> Affections ſo ſadly alienated from the Love of God and Goodneſs: All theſe things conſider'd, 'twere greatly to be wiſht, our Play-Houſes were totally ſuppreſt. However, in the mean time, I think it concerns all, that will be ſecure from ever Apoſtatizing from the Faith of Chriſt, and a Religious Life, ſo far to Reject theſe our modern Pomps, as never to Enter within thoſe Houſes, where theſe Plays are acted.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, By Pomps,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> By Pomps in the Sence of the Ancients were meant, the ſolemn Proceſſions of the Heathens in Honour of their Gods.</note> in the Sence of the Ancients (as ſome do think) are meant the Solemn <hi>Proceſſions</hi> of the Heathens, wherein they carried the Images of their Gods, through the Streets of the City, in a moſt Pompous manner, all the Prieſts, Magiſtrates, and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> does repreſent it, Attending and Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Veneration towards them.</p>
                  <p>And anſwerably to theſe, without the leaſt ſtraining of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the preſent State of the Church, may be underſtood, thoſe Idolatrous Proceſſions amongſt the Papiſts; where ſometimes the Images of the Saints, ſometimes the <hi>Hoſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions of the Papiſts, in honour of the Saints, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to theſe;</note> is carried in the ſame Solemn manner, as among the Pagans, were the Images of their Gods: And the like Adoration and Worſhip requir'd from all, who accompany, or accidentally fall amongſt 'em, out of Curioſity to obſerve their Vanities. And as amongſt the Ancients, thoſe were Cenſur'd as Partakers with the Heathen in their Idolatry, who went along with them, or were publick Spectators of 'em, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſignifying to the Eyes of Men, their Allowance and Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, and of the Idolatry they contain'd; and were certain to be caſt out of the <hi>Communion of the Church</hi> for the ſame:<note place="margin">And muſt not therefore be joined in.</note> So thoſe Proteſtant Gentlemen, who Travelling into Forreign Countries, out of Curioſity to obſerve the Popiſh Vanities, ſhall Voluntarily appear amongſt the Train accompanying them, cannot be thought more Favourably of. And if through Force they are Compell'd to join in the Adoration of thoſe Images, and ſhall rather comply, than ſuffer, they are wanting in Diſcharging that great Duty of <hi>Confeſſing of Chriſt,</hi> which is ſo ſtrictly requir'd at our Hands, as ever we expect to have him <hi>Confeſs us before God, and his Holy Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, By Pomps may be meant reductively,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>III.</hi> By Pomps Reductively, may be meant the Revels &amp; Drunken Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots of our Youth at Wakes and Festivals.</note> all thoſe <hi>Revels</hi> and Riotous Meetings of Youth, whereby our Great <hi>Feſtivals</hi> Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly inſtituted by the Church, to be kept with Joyful Thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to God, for his ſingular Favours vouchſafed to the World, as at ſuch Times, are ſo ſadly Profan'd by Drunkenneſs, lewd Songs and Ballads, profane and wanton Diſcourſe, and the like. The Generality of our common People, ſeem to apprehend nothing Spiritual in the Great Feaſts of <hi>Chriſtmas, Eaſter,</hi> and <hi>Whitſuntide.</hi> And a <hi>Holyday</hi> is with them, the Profaneſt Day in the Year. But I will be bold to aſſert, with the Learned Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> that beſides theſe other Sences of the Word <hi>Pomps;</hi> 
                     <q>All the ſinful Courſes that are us'd by Men in their Times of Jollity and Feſtivity, the Luxury, and Riot, and unlawful Gaming; and all Kind of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes (which are but a Copying out the Heathen <hi>Bacchanals</hi>) are Pomps to be Renounced by every Chriſtian. All Riot and Exceſs, lewd and wanton Actions, and Diſcourſes are Sins, and that far greater, and more puniſhable in Chriſtians, than in Others; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly than in Jews, whoſe Promiſes of an Earthly Plenty are
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:151517:186"/> not ſo contrary and irreconcilable with Corporal Exceſſes, as are the ſpiritual Joys, that are the Chriſtian's eminent Portion under Promiſe. And therefore theſe are turned out of the World by Chriſt, and by him transform'd and chang'd into ſpiritual Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations, bleſſing and praiſing God, into Feaſts of Charity, and ſober Hoſpitality, and Bounty to the Poor, inſtead of thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, coſtly vain Pomps, which the Eye of the World is ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Theſe to be Abſtain'd from.</note>And therefore, as I would adviſe you to be little fond of Wakes, and ſuch like Meetings of Promiſcuous Company, where little Good,<note place="margin">Quacunque ex cauſa fuerint producti Primo, nil eſt perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioſius morum Integritati. Quippe turba omnis utique a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimo gravis &amp; noxia; nec enim quos extuliſti mores un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam refers; nemo non ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biginis aliquid aut imprimit, aut Neſcientibus allinit, <hi>Coel. Rhodgi. Lib. Octav. c. 7.</hi>
                     </note> and a great deal of Ill is commonly learnt: So eſpecially, let me Entreat you, never to take into your Hands, much leſs to learn thoſe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Ballads by Heart, which do inſenſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the Poiſon of ill Morals into the Soul, and ſuch a diſ-reliſh to ſpiritual Thoughts and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, as can many times be never wore off. And ſo much for the Pomps of the World.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, And as the Pomps, ſo you are alſo to Renounce and Reject the <hi>Vanity of this World.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vanity of the World, What?</note> And what indeed that does mean, it is not ſo hard to gueſs, for we have it every Day before our Eyes. And that which I do ſuppoſe is chiefly thereby meant, are all <hi>Affectation of Grandeur and Greatneſs in ſumptuous Houſes, rich Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, uppermoſt Places, Titles of Reſpect, and coſtly Apparel.</hi> True it is, theſe things are not in themſelves purely and abſolutely Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, but may be enjoy'd without Sin, by thoſe who are lawfully poſſeſt of 'em. Nevertheleſs theſe have an Aptneſs in them, more than moſt other things of the World, to corrupt Men's Minds, and to <hi>Alienate their Affections</hi> from the Love of God, and Goodneſs: However the <hi>Affectation</hi> of 'em is undoubtedly a <hi>Sinful Vanity to be Renounced</hi> by every Chriſtian. And ſuch vain Affectation does appear in theſe Caſes following:</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> When Perſons out-goe their Ability, in Building and Furniture.</note>Firſt, <hi>As to ſumptuous Houſes, and rich Furniture, when Perſons out-goe their Ability</hi> in compaſſing thoſe things, to the Ruine, or great Prejudice of their Families and Poſterity; and do Build and Buy, not paying the Labourer, and the Tradeſman; and when with all their Care to Beautify and Adorn their own Houſes, they care not how Ruinous and Indecent the Houſes of God do lie. Thus to affect Sumptuouſneſs, I ſay, is a ſinful Vanity. Thus the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> 22.13, 14. pronounceth a <hi>Woe unto him that buildeth his Houſe by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs, and his Chambers by Wrong, that uſeth his Neighbours Service without Wages, and giveth him not for his Work; that ſaith, I will build me a wide Houſe, and large Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and cutteth him out Windows, and it is cieled with Cedar, and painted with Vermilion.</hi> And as for thoſe who build, and deck, and trim up their own Houſes, and ſuffer God's Houſe to be in Ruine and Decay, to lie uncomely and naſtily, they had beſt to conſider how ill God will take it, as appears from that of Hag. 1.4. <hi>Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in the cieled Houſes, and this Houſe lie waſt?</hi> And in the Verſes following, he denounceth a Conſumption on all they have, for ſuch Impiety. So ſinful a thing is the vain Affectation of ſumptuous Houſes, and rich Furniture, when

And even Good Men, who can heartily own, and ſorrowfully bewail in their Confeſſions to God, that they are vile Sinners, will hardly endure that others ſhould ſay ſo, or think ſo ill of 'em. But ſo far ſhould we be from affecting ſuch Reſpects, as are above our Merit, that we ſhould not over-eagerly deſire thoſe that are deſerved, and due to us; nor muſt we Plume and Pride our ſelves when we have 'em. To do otherwiſe proceeds from an Ambition, which ill-becomes the Diſciple of Him, that was ſo exceeding Lowly, <hi>Who, tho' he was Lord of all, yet came here into the World, not to be Miniſtred unto, but to Miniſter,</hi> Matth. 20.28.

                  </p>
                  <p>Well: But after all I am ſenſible, I have fall'n upon as Nice a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as any can be Handled, there being Nothing wherein the World will, with ſo much Uneaſineſs bear a Contradiction, as in this Point of its Vanities, and eſpecially in the matter of Apparel: For whilſt ſome are ſo ſtrait-lac'd, as to Cenſure every thing, that is <hi>ornamental</hi> in our way of living; and ſo many others, on the contrary, are ſo ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Profuſe to a high degree of Vanity, it is hard to determine this caſe, ſo as not incur the Prejudice of one, or other. I will therefore chooſe to give, in the Words of the Learned Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> the true State of this matter, ſhewing what Allowances, without imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Vanity, may be granted in the Uſe of <hi>Ornamentals;</hi> and how far, on the other ſide, they are to be Renounc'd by you.</p>
                  <p>And herein this Great Father of our Church gives this prudent Advice,</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>That none go above what the Soberer and Graver ſort of his Quality and Condition do uſe; that they Abſtain, as much as may be, from the frequent Changing and Inventing of Faſhions, from the being earlieſt in every New Dreſs, or from Singularity of Apparel, us'd on purpoſe, and on that Affectation, becauſe it is Singular; for all theſe ſeem ſo far to Betray the ſinful Principle, that tho' it is not reaſonable, for one Man to judge another, for every thing of this nature; yet it will be fit for all, that do thus, to examine and charge it upon themſelves, and if they cannot perfectly clear themſelves from that evil Principle, or worſe End, then to remember, that this is it, which they Renounced in their Baptiſm.</p>
                     <p>The ſhort is this, <hi>Decency</hi> is that, he ſays,<note place="margin">Decency ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what is ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to Age, Sex, or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the Rule in this Caſe.</note> which muſt give Limits to Attires: This Decency is to be taken from that, which is Uſual and Cuſtomary amongſt thoſe, with whom we Live, and is oft varied by Change of Times, and of the Condition of the Age, or Dignity of each Perſon (that being Comely for one Age, and Sex, and Quality of Perſons, which is not for another:) And He, or She, that reſts contented with thoſe ways of Adorning themſelves, which are moſt uſual among the more Sober and Grave of their Age and Quality, are not to be judg'd guilty of the Breach of this Vow; tho' there are perhaps ſome Things in their Attire, Gold, Jewels, and the like, which might be thought to own this Title of <hi>Pomps</hi> and <hi>Vanities,</hi> as thoſe words ſignify Bravery and Superfluity.</p>

                     <p>Nevertheleſs the Truth is, (as he goes on) it were to be wiſht, that Men and Women of the higheſt Quality, would chooſe to Diſtinguiſh themſelves from others, rather by that <hi>Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit</hi> (commended to the weaker Sex, by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as a far more amiable Ornament, than that of Apparel;) and make ſhew of their Wealth, by thoſe more profitable, beneficial Expences, for the ſupply of the Wants of others. And no doubt, this would contribute more to their own Ends, (if they be the Aims of Chriſtians) and would ſet them out more in the Opinion of all wiſe and good Perſons. But this being affirm'd, will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Uſe of any of thoſe Ornaments, which are agreeable to Time, and Place, and Callings, to be Sinful, or of the Number of thoſe Vanities, that are to be Renounced in our Baptiſm.</p>

                  <p>IN the Explication of theſe Words, I have fully laid before you the Stratagems and Wiles of <hi>Satan,</hi> and the various <hi>Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> alſo wherewith the <hi>World</hi> doth aſſault us, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw us from God, and to make us break our Covenant with him.

                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed this is a moſt Material and Important Part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Knowledge.

And if we did but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly Know the Imperfection and Weakneſſes of our Corrupted Nature, and of all the Powers and Faculties within us; neither the whole World with all its formidable Hoſt of Temptations, nor Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan himſelf Marſhalling and managing of 'em againſt us, with all the Malice and Cunning he is Maſter of, would be in much danger of doing us hurt. For tho' our Caſe is that of a Beſieged Fort, to take which there are not only a numerous Army, under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a wary General, who narrowly views every part of us, and orders the Attack where he finds us weakeſt; but what is worſe, the whole Fabrick of our Corrupted Nature is extreamly decay'd; and all the Faculties and Powers thereof, are but ſo many Traytors within us, ready to deliver us up to our Enemies. Yet however in knowing the Weakneſs of our Nature, we may be able to repair its Decays; and by knowing alſo the Treachery of all its Faculties, we ſhall ſucceſsfully prevent their delivering of us up to our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries: And therefore, for the more full Diſcovery of ſo uſeful and important a Subject to you,</p>

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:151517:189"/> place enquire what was the Original Frame and Conſtitution of Man: In what the Image of God, wherein he was created at firſt, conſiſted; and how that in all the Faculties and Powers of Soul and Body, his whole Bent and Inclinations were originally Heavenward; for by thus comparing the upright Nature of Man, as it was at firſt Created, with what it now is in this State of Corruption, we ſhall be able clearly to apprehend what is meant by the Fleſh, the important Subject of our preſent Enquiry.</p>
                  <p>And now as to the Original Frame and Conſtitution of our Nature wherein God made us, it ſeems, to have been this.<note place="margin">The Original Frame and Conſtitution, of Humane Nature, what.</note> He gave Man a Faculty of Underſtanding, whereby he could Contemplate upon, and Know in an Extraordinary meaſure, the wonderful Nature and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of his Creator! His amazing Works of Creation! His ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Works of Providence! and thereby was able to diſcover the Good and Evil in any Objects that were preſented to him. Next, he plac'd in his Boſom another wonderful Faculty, called Conſcience; which is the practical Judgment in every Man, whereby his own Mind, out of that vaſt Treaſure of uſeful Knowledge, did dictate to him what was Good, and to be choſen; what was Evil, and to be refus'd by him; and upon which Choice of Good, and Rejecting of Evil, its Office was to give its Teſtimony of Well-done, to the Good and Faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, to his unſpeakable Comfort and Satisfaction. Next, in the Upright Nature of Man, as it bore upon it the Image and Likeneſs of God, there was plac'd a Will, which of it ſelf is a blind Faculty, and chuſes and refuſes, according to the Information of others. And in the State of Innocence, it was entirely complying with the Dictates of Reaſon and Conſcience. And to deſcend from the Rational to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior and Bodily Powers: It was the Divine Goodneſs did implant in our Natures thoſe, which we call the Paſſions and Affections in a Man; which are principally theſe, <hi>Admiration, Love,</hi> and <hi>Hatred.</hi> And it was to very excellent Purpoſes that theſe were given us. The uſe of Admiration was, as to things which ſhould offer themſelves to our Approbation; if Good, that we might put a true value upon them according to their Worth; if Bad, that we might deſpiſe 'em, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Vanity and Evil we ſhould find in 'em. And as to the two other principal Paſſions of Love and Hatred, God's deſign in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting in our Hearts the former, was to move and ſtir us up with Vigour and Activity, to purſue whatever we ſhould find good and convenient to us. And the Paſſion of Hatred was put into our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that we might avoid on the contrary whatever might be found hurtful and offenſive. And it was no other than the Divine Goodneſs, which in the Nature of Man did place certain Appetites and Luſts. Every particular Man had, even at his firſt Creation, Appetites to Food and Suſtenance, in order to preſerve his own Being in Life and Health. And Cupidity, or the Inclinations of the Sex to each other, was in order to the Multiplication of Mankind.</p>
                  <p>This now was the Original Frame and Conſtitution of Man.<note place="margin">The Image of God, wherein Man was at firſt Created, what.</note> And in the Perfection, Order, and Purity of all the Faculties and Powers of Soul and Body, according to this Original Frame and Conſtitution, did the Image of God, in which he was at firſt Created, conſiſt. So long as the whole Nature of Man was perfect in all parts, the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding quick in diſcerning momentous and weighty Truths, the

                     <note place="margin">The Bent and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soul towards God, what.</note>And ſo long as he continued thus, it is plain alſo, that the whole Bent and Inclination of the Soul was towards God, that to him it did point in all its Motions, and did fix upon him as the End of all its Actions; and did love him with the intenſeſt degrees of Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And that even the Bodily Part was perfectly compliant with the Soul in ſerving it entirely and ſolely to that End. So that thus you ſee what was the Original Frame and Conſtitution of Man: In what the Image of God, wherein he was created at firſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted: And that in all the Faculties and Powers of Soul and Body, his whole Bent and Inclinations were Heaven-ward.</p>
                  <p>But now in the Unregenerate Nature all this Excellent Frame and Conſtitution is broken: This Image of God is defac'd; and all the Faculties and Powers of Soul and Body, inſtead of inclining towards, and Centring upon God and Heavenly Things, tend downwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Creature.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the Unregenerate Nature, I ſay; That Excellent Frame and Conſtitution, wherein Man was Originally Created, is now broken:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> In the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Original Frame and Conſtitution of Man, wherein he was Created, is broken.</note> So that inſtead of that Harmonious Subordination of the inferior Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to the Superior; inſtead of the Will's being ſubject to the Dictates of the Underſtanding, and the Affections being ſubject to the Commands and Sovereignty of the Will, and the Luſts and Appetites being Obedient to Right Reaſon, and a well-inform'd Conſcience; inſtead of this, the whole Order and Frame of Humane Nature is now turn'd upſide down: The Affections, Luſts and Appetites do now Reign, and Reaſon and Conſcience are dragg'd after them in miſerable Slavery. And as to the Will of an Unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Man, the moſt that it can do, is not without <hi>Reluctance</hi> and <hi>Regret,</hi> to comply with the Temptations of the Senſes; like him in St. <hi>Paul, I know that in me, that is, in my Fleſh, dwelleth no good thing; for to will is preſent with me; but how to perform that which is good, I find not; for the Good that I would, I do not; but the Evil which I would not, that I do,</hi> Rom. 7.18, 19. The beſt that can be ſuppos'd of the Unregenerate Man is this, that after the Preaching of the Laws of God to him, and a Divine Light has been let thereby into his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, he does approve in his own Mind of the Ways of God as moſt excellent. Such was he, in St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7.22. <hi>I delight in the Law of God after the inward Man;</hi> that is, according to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding or Superior Faculty, contrary to the carnal or bodily part of him; ſuch a one does approve of what the Laws of God do preſcribe. But then alas he muſt own, that <hi>he ſees another Law in his Members, warring againſt the Law of his Mind, and bringing him into Captivity to the Law of Sin, which is in his Members,</hi> v. 23. So that the State of an Unregenerate Man is a State of meer Confuſion, Diſorder, and Rebellion, the Affections, Luſts and Appetites, riſing up in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Dictates of the Mind and Conſcience: And it is a State of meer Impotency and Weakneſs, the Mind and Conſcience being ſo
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:151517:190"/> far unable to govern the Affections, Luſts and Appetites, that theſe latter get the better of the day, carry the Mind and Reaſon captive, and force it ſlaviſhly to do what the Fleſh requires to have done by it, ſo exceedingly ſpoil'd, and broken in the Unregenerate Nature, is all that excellent Frame &amp; Conſtitution wherein Man was at firſt created.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And conſequently then, <hi>the Image of God,</hi> wherein Man was at firſt Created, muſt needs be miſerably defac'd<note place="margin">

In that excellent Perfection and Order, which appear'd in the Frame and Conſtitution of Humane Nature it was, that thoſe lively Strokes of the Divine Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs, were plainly viſible. But as a miſhapen and monſtrous Picture, in which there is nothing of Regularity and good Feature, cannot without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury be ſaid to Reſemble ſome Excellent and Goodly Perſonage; ſo neither can the defac'd and deform'd Nature of an Unregenerate Man be ſaid to be made <hi>after the Likeneſs of God.</hi> Some faint and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Reſemblances, true it is, do ſtill remain under all thoſe Deface<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; even as in the Ruines of a ſtately Palace, there may appear ſomething of admirable Architecture. There is ſtill remaining in the moſt Corrupt Nature; True it is; that part of the Image of God which conſiſted in thoſe things which are Eſſential to Man, as Man, that is, the Soul, and all its Faculties of Underſtanding, Will, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, theſe do ſtill remain the ſame for Subſtance as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But the Image of God as it conſiſts in our Moral Perfections; <hi>viz.</hi> in the Order and good Harmony of the ſeveral Faculties of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, with reſpect one to another, and in that Perfection which did Originally belong to each ſingle Faculty; The Image of God, I ſay in this reſpect, is miſerably defac'd in the Natural Man.</p>
                  <p>As to the good Harmony of the ſeveral Faculties and Powers of Humane Nature, you have already ſeen how that is ſpoil'd. And as to the Perfection which ſhould be in every one of theſe ſeveral Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, that in an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nregenerate Man</hi> is very little. Alas in his Underſtanding, what is there now but Blindneſs and Darkneſs? What in his Will, but Stubborneſs and Perverſeneſs? What in his Affections, but Violence and Diſorder? And what in his Luſts and Appetites, but Senſuality and Irregularity? So ſadly is the whole Nature of the Unregenerate Man Corrupted, ſo that little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Image of God does now remain in him.</p>
                  <p>But, Laſtly, above all, Man in his Unregenerate Nature is now miſerably alter'd from what he was; in that all the Faculties and Powers of Soul and Body, inſtead of inclining towards, and Centring upon God and Heavenly Things, tend downwards towards the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.<note place="margin">Laſtly, the Tendency of all the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, both of Soul and Body, are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Creature.</note> As to the Appetites and Deſires in the Unregenerate, they are in a manner wholly ſenſual, and are hardly ever to be ſatisfy'd with what gratifies the Senſes. The Affections alſo are wholly ſet upon worldly Enjoyments, and the Will does alſo prefer and chuſe ſuch far before Spiritual Conſolations. And what is more, in the Unregenerate Man, the very <hi>Mind and Conſcience is defil'd,</hi> Tit. 1.15. <hi>And they who are after the Fleſh, do mind the things of the Fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8.5. <hi>do mind Earthly Things,</hi> Phil. 3.14. Their whole Thoughts and Contrivances, their Meditations and Purpoſes are wholly upon thoſe poor and paltry Vanities of this World, and are altogether taken up <hi>in making Proviſions for the Fleſh,</hi> and their Hearts and Affections cling
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:151517:191"/> cloſely and ſolely to the Earth. Hence it is ſaid of ſuch, that <hi>they live after the Fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8.13. and that <hi>they walk after the Fleſh,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.10. they are ſo wholly addicted to Fleſhly and Worldly Things. And thus you ſee what is meant by the Fleſh.</p>
                  <p>And now it is time to conſider <hi>in what Sence, and how far we muſt Renounce the Fleſh.</hi> And, 1. The Fleſh muſt be Renounc'd by <hi>our being Renew'd in the whole Frame and Conſtitution of our Nature after the Image of God.</hi>

The Will, which is now obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately bent againſt the Ways of Righteouſneſs, muſt be made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant with God's Will: The Affections, which are now ſet upon Worldly Things, muſt be call'd off from theſe Earthly Vanities, and fix'd upon Spiritual and Heavenly Objects. And Laſtly, the Luſts and Appetites, which in the State of Nature are continually Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt the Mind, muſt be Reduc'd to their Original Subjection to Right Reaſon, which is called <hi>Crucifying of the Fleſh with its Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Luſts,</hi> Gal. 5.24. <hi>and mortifying our Earthly Members,</hi> Col. 3.5. Thus muſt the whole Corrupt Nature be Reſtor'd, as near as it can, to its firſt Conſtitution, and that Divine Likeneſs wherewith it was at firſt ſtampt.</p>

The moſt Univerſal Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is not free from Ignorance and Error; the Will, which is moſt complying with the Commands of God, has ſometimes its contrary Velleities, or Wouldings; the Affections which are moſt Refin'd are ſometimes Inordinate and Earthly; ſo that every Faculty of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and every Action we do, have ſome mixture of Sin and Frailty.

For it is only true Religion that teaches and enables Men to die to this World, and to all Earthly Things, and to riſe above the Sphere of Senſual and Earthly Pleaſures, which darken the Mind and blind it, that it cannot enjoy the brightneſs of Divine Light; ſo that whereas the Fleſhly Mind never minds any thing but Fleſh, and never riſes above the Outward Matter, but always creeps up and down like Shadows upon the Surface of the Earth; and if it begin at any time to make any faint Eſſays upwards, it preſently finds it ſelf laden with a weight of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, which draws it down again; Holy and Religious Souls being touch'd with an Inward Senſe of the Divine Goodneſs and Beauty, are mov'd ſwiftly after God, and as the Apoſtle expreſſes himſelf, forgetting thoſe things which are behind, and reaching forth to thoſe things which are before, they preſs towards the Mark for the Prize of the high Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God in Chriſt Jeſus; that ſo they may attain to the Reſurrection of the De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>IN order to the full Explication of theſe Words, <hi>the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh, what.</note> Having already ſhew'd you, Firſt, what is meant by the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and in what Sence, and how far <hi>we muſt Renounce the Fleſh.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And as by the Fleſh is meant the whole Unregenerate Nature of Man, Soul as well as Body in its State of Corruption, and as it acts contrary to the Holy Will and Spirit of God; ſo proportionably by the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh, muſt be underſtood all the Faculties and Powers of this corrupted Nature, as they carry us out to commit Sin, as well the Faculties of the Soul, the Underſtanding and Will, as the Bodily Powers; <hi>viz.</hi> the Affections, Luſts and Appetites.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are all of 'em, in their own Nature, the Effects of God's Workmanſhip, and were Pure as they came forth of his Hands: But ever ſince the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> they are wofully Corrupted, and there is none of theſe Faculties, or Powers, either of Soul, or Body, but may be call'd a <hi>ſinful Luſt of the Fleſh.</hi> Every Faculty and Power of Soul and Body is properly enough term'd a <hi>Luſt,</hi> as it Craves and Deſires its Object.

I will take the whole Frame of this our depraved Nature in Pieces, that ſo viewing that Corruption, which reſiding in every of the Faculties and Powers thereof, renders all of 'em ſo many <hi>ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh,</hi> we may be better able to Renounce each of thoſe ſinful and fleſhly Luſts.</p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:151517:192"/>
                  <p>And Firſt,<note place="margin">The Sinful Luſts of the Fleſhly Mind what.</note> Let us conſider that Corruption which Reſides in the Mind, and renders it Fleſhly, and conſequently the Motions even of the Intellectual part of our Nature, no better than <hi>Sinful Luſts of the Fleſh.</hi> And our Underſtanding, alas, which ſhould be full of Divine Knowledge, ſuch as may be a Lamp unto our Feet, and a Light unto our Paths, is in the Unregenerate Man full of Vanity, Ignorance of, and Prejudice againſt Divine Truths. The Unregenerate Man neither <hi>underſtands nor ſeeks after God,</hi> Rom. 3.11. <hi>He likes not to Retain God in his Knowledge,</hi> or to conſider any thing concerning him, <hi>but is vain in his Imaginations, having his fooliſh heart darkned,</hi> Rom. 1.21.28. Nay, the beſt Habits of the Mind in the Unregenerate Man are Corrupt, <hi>having the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding darkned, being Alienated from the Life of God, through the Ignorance that is in them,</hi> Eph. 4.18. And hence it comes to paſs, that whereas the great and proper Appetite of the Mind is after Knowledge, an Appetite which God hath put into the Soul of Man, and ſo a thing Beautiful and Good: This very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Knowledge becomes a ſinful Luſt of the Fleſhly Mind in ſeveral Caſes, particularly in theſe following; <hi>viz.</hi> when either we miſplace our Deſires of Knowledge upon wrong Objects, or when we do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately ſtudy to be exquiſitely skill'd in Humane, tho' Lawful Arts and Sciences, to the Neglect and Contempt of Divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And laſtly, when out of Pride, Prejudice and Contradiction to all ſacred Truths, we ſet up our own Fleſhly Imaginations and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings againſt the Spiritual Notions that are dictated to us. And accordingly ſuch our Appetites or Deſires, even of Knowledge it ſelf, muſt be Renounced, as ſo many ſinful Luſts of a Fleſhly Mind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And firſt we muſt Renounce the Deſires of Knowing wrong Objects;</hi> that is, we muſt not Gratify, but Mortify our Deſires of Knowing ſuch things, which are either <hi>Hurtful to be known,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> When we are curious to to know things which are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hurtful to be Known,</note> or are not <hi>proper for Man to know.</hi> Now as to this we are to conſider, that there is a certain Diſtemper of Mind, called Curioſity, which as it is of like Nature, ſo it is of full as hurtful and miſchievous Effects to the Mind, as that Diſtemper is to the Body, which ſtirs up Perſons to eat Chalk, or Coals, or Traſh, or whatever affords either none at all, or a very ill Nouriſhment: Such is the Curioſity of Knowing Evil, which was the thing that ruin'd our firſt Parents, and afterwards <hi>Solomon,</hi> and ſince him, many other Perſons: Such are they who have a great deſire to taſt thoſe Pleaſures which are in Sin, and by taſting of 'em their Minds are defil'd, and their Morals corrupted, and it is ſeldom that they do ever after return to have a right Judgment of Good or Evil. Thus hurtful is the Knowledge of ſome things, ſo that it is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be Ignorant thereof, than to Know 'em.</p>
                  <p>Again there are others, whoſe Curioſity gives 'em a ſtrange Itch <hi>to know Hidden Things, ſuch as are not proper for Man to know,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Or not proper for Man to know.</note> as the Decrees of Predeſtination, and the Counſels of God's Will, which is the Ark that no mortal Eye ought to look into. And many are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Inquiſitive to learn the future Events of Kingdoms and States, and of their own and others private Fortunes. And therefore it is, that they are ſo apt to give heed to every pretended Prophecy; and tho' few are ſo very wicked, as to Conſult Evil Spirits themſelves by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Arts, yet Multitudes will make no ſcruple to Reſort to Fortune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellers and Conjurers; and thoſe that do conſult 'em, or are reputed

But the Knowledge of God and Religion, if duly apply'd, never fails to cure the Soul of all its Infirmities, nor will it fail to fill the Mind with the ſweeteſt Comforts and Satisfactions. Others you ſhall have who deſire and care for nothing more than good Skill in the Laws of their Country, whereby they may raiſe themſelves good Eſtates in this World; but alas, ſuch Knowledg can only ſerve a preſent Intereſt; but by the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Chriſtianity we may be able to <hi>provide our ſelves Bags that wax not old, Eternal in the Heavens.</hi> Some are wholly bent upon Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize and Trade, but when the moſt Skilful Pilot ſhall ſplit upon the Rocks, or be foundred in the Sands, he who has Heaven in his Eye may ſteer his Courſe without danger through the rougheſt Billows of Adverſe Fortune. And others there are who ſeem to aim at no higher Knowledge, than how to Till their Land, and feed their Cattle, and when after all the Crop fails the moſt painful Husbandman, he who knows the Laws of Chriſtianity need not fear a joyful and a plentiful Harveſt; ſo excellent and uſeful is Divine Knowledge above all other Arts and Sciences.<note place="margin">The Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as it ſerves to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler Purpoſes, ſo ought it to be prefer'd to any other.</note> Not that I would caſt a Diſparagement upon them; they are the Gift of God, and uſeful in their kind; but the Knowledge of our Chriſtian Religion, as it ſerves to nobler and better Purpoſes, ſo ought it to be prefer'd to any other, and moſt ſtudy'd by every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. And hence therefore does St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he comes at any time to ſpeak of Divine Knowledge, not only barely enjoin the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of it, as of other Vertues, but does moreover add Prayers and Supplications to God to endow 'em therewith, and to increaſe 'em therein. <hi>We do not ceaſe to pray for you, and to deſire that ye might be filled with the Knowledge of his Will in all Wiſdom and Spiritual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that ye might walk worthy of the Lord in all pleaſing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruitful in every good Work, and increaſing in the Knowledge of God,</hi> Col. 1.9, 10. And again, <hi>I ceaſe not,</hi> ſays he, <hi>making mention of you always in my Prayers, that the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of Glory, may give unto you the Spirit of Wiſdom and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:151517:193"/> in the Knowledge of him,</hi> Eph. 1.16, 17. So that tho' to be excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well skill'd in any Art or Science whatſoever, which terminates only in the Conveniencies of this Life, be not only Lawful, but Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, yet it is a Profaneneſs fit to be Renounc'd by every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, to prefer ſuch to Divine Knowledge, and to apply your Mind wholly to the attaining of ſuch Skill, to the Neglect of thoſe Great and Important Truths, the Knowledge of which is indiſpenſably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to our Everlaſting Happineſs. And therefore let your Profeſſion and Calling be what it will, you muſt make it your firſt Care and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to know the Nature and Deſign of the Chriſtian Religion,<note place="margin">The neceſſary Points of Chriſtian Knowledge.</note> how that it is a Body of the moſt Excellent Principles and Laws, all of 'em tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly to render you Holy and Good Livers, and then to make you to depend upon the Mediation of Chriſt with his Father, for his Acceptance thereof to your Juſtification. You muſt alſo next make it more your Study to underſtand throughly the Covenant of Grace, than the Nature and Obligation of any Humane Covenants or Contracts, whatſoever. And ſince we muſt build our Hopes upon the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of particular Articles, and as exactly as poſſible ſquare our Lives according to each ſingle Condition of the Covenant of Grace, there can be nothing of more concernment to every Chriſtian, <hi>Lay</hi> as well as <hi>Clergy,</hi> than throughly to underſtand, both the Meaning and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of every Doctrine of Faith, and the Nature and Extent of every Chriſtian Duty. And laſtly, ſince a good End can never be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd without the Knowledge and Uſe of due and proper means, the Nature therefore and Uſe of Prayer, and the Nature and End of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments muſt be a moſt neceſſary part of Chriſtian Knowledge. So much muſt our Appetites after Knowledge in the moſt Excellent of Humane Arts and Science be Renounc'd, in compariſon of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after a competent Meaſure of Divine Knowledge.</p>

                        <hi>III.</hi> When out of Pride, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and contradiction to all Sacred Truths, we ſet up our own Carnal Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, &amp; Fleſhly Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe Spiritual No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and thoſe Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of our Faith, which are deliver'd to us in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> 
                     <hi>Above all we muſt Renounce</hi> that prevailing Appetite in ſuch as are of moſt Depraved and Corrupt Minds, viz. <hi>The ſetting up their own Imaginations and Fleſhly Reaſonings againſt thoſe Spiritual Notions, and thoſe more Myſterious Articles of Faith, which are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to us in the Scripture.</hi> In the more depraved Nature of ſome Men, there is a great deal of Untowardneſs and Difficulty to ſubmit to the ſacred Truths Revealed to us by Chriſt in the Goſpel, as to Matters of Faith, or ſuch Articles as are neceſſary to be believ'd: One that is conceited of his own Wiſdom, ſtrength of Parts, or Improvement in Knowledge, will not ſubmit his Reaſon to entertain Notions which he cannot <hi>Comprehend</hi> and Penetrate. <hi>The Carnal Mind which is En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt God,</hi> Rom. 8.7. will diſdain to have his Underſtanding baffl'd or puzzl'd with ſublime Myſteries of Faith, he will quarrel at any thing too high for his Wit to reach, or too Knotty for him to unlooſe. How can theſe things be? What Reaſon can there be for this? I cannot ſee how this can be true. This Point is not intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; And perhaps he finds fault with the whole Body of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, either becauſe ſome things are obſcure to him, or the Phraſe is not queint and fine enough. Thus the Carnal Mind treateth the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Faith, and the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>But far be it from Chriſtians thus to indulge their own Carnal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, and Self-Conceits, in oppoſition to what God has Reveal'd to us, as neceſſary to be Believ'd by us. For certainly the Infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:151517:194"/> both knows what is fitteſt to be taught and reveal'd to us, and in what Manner and Method he had beſt to expreſs himſelf. Thoſe that did thus proudly deſpiſe the Wiſdom of God, meaſuring it according to their own Talent of Wit and Underſtanding, did at firſt, and do to this Day moſt fatally miſcarry; for it is written, 1 Cor. 1.19. <hi>I will deſtroy the Wiſdom of the Wiſe, and will bring to nothing the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Prudent.</hi> But our Duty is to ſubmit our Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Almighty God, to be Inlighten'd by his infinite Wiſdom, <hi>Caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down Imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the Knowledge of God, and bringing into Captivity every Thought to the Obedience of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.5. There is a great deal of Vertue and Grace in an Obedient Underſtanding, and therefore to the Diſciples who were ſo diſpos'd, <hi>To them it was given,</hi> as our Saviour tells us, Matth. 13.11. <hi>To underſtand the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven; but to them</hi> who are not prepar'd with an humble Mind, <hi>it is not given.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor is this an hard Impoſition upon Mankind, to oblige 'em to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what is above our Reaſon to Comprehend. It is ſufficient that the Holy Scriptures which do deliver ſuch Articles of Faith, as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be Believ'd, are ſufficiently witneſſed to be Divine Revelations; and that there is nothing contain'd in the Articles or Myſteries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which is contrary or contradictory to that Reaſon which God has given to Man. But that there ſhould be any thing in an Article of Faith, which, though it be above our Reaſon to Comprehend, (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in this its State of weakneſs) muſt yet be Believ'd, will not ſeem hard, if we conſider, that there are many Appearances, even in Nature it ſelf, which no Man has been yet found who could give a tolerable account for; and yet the truth of their being ſo and ſo, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be call'd in queſtion.</p>

                     <q>And as to this Faculty we are to conſider, how that God gave to Man a Righteous Law, which was to be the Rule of his Will; and while it was conformable to this, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Will of God, and conſequently Beautiful and Regular; but inſtead thereof, there is now <hi>a Law of Sin and Death,</hi> Rom. 8.2. And this Law ſubdues the Law of the Mind, and brings the Soul <hi>into Captivity to the Law of Sin,</hi> Rom. 7.23.

                     </q> But in its corrupt State being always Averſe to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of God's Laws and Right Reaſon, it perverſly chuſes thoſe things which pleaſe only the Senſes, and ſo becomes, in the moſt proper and immediate Sence of the Word, a Sinful and <hi>Fleſhly Luſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as obſtinately bent, as the Corrupt Will is found to be, againſt complying with the Laws of God, which would guide our Souls upwards, we muſt bring our ſelves to that Habit of Self-denial, ſo as readily to ſubmit our Wills to God's Laws, to be Governed by 'em; the reaſon is, we are not our own, and therefore our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Wills ought not to bear Rule in us, but we are God's Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and his Subjects and Servants, and therefore his All-wiſe Will and Pleaſure ſhould be the Rule and Meaſure of, and preſide over all our Actions. And this it muſt do in the moſt difficult Caſes, when his Laws ſeem moſt to thwart our Reaſon, and his Diſpenſations ſeem moſt hard and ſevere.

                     <hi>The Affections in the Carnal Man do ſadly degenerate into what may too properly be called the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh.</hi> Our Paſſions and Affections are indeed in themſelves of ſingular uſe to the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Natures. They are the Wings of the Soul to carry it forth with eagerneſs in the purſuit of that which is Good, and with Averſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Flight from that which is Evil. They are variouſly numbred up, but the Maſter Affections are <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hatred,</hi> which when they are rightly governed, all the reſt are ſo too; but when they are miſplac'd and out of order, ſo in the ſame proportion are all the others. And accordingly, whereas then it is, that our Love is rightly fix'd; 1. <hi>When we place it upon a proper Object:</hi> And, 2. <hi>When we ſteer towards the Thing we love, with Deſires proportionable to the Good that is in the Object,</hi> that is, <q>When the beſt and greateſt Things are purſu'd with our chiefeſt Paſſions, middle Things with a leſs, and the loweſt with the leaſt;</q> So it is, that ſo long as a Perſon remains Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, he either firſt places his Love upon that which he ſhould Hate, which is the wrong Object, as upon ſinful Profits and Pleaſures; or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly he loves Things of an Indifferent Nature, ſuch as are Earthly Things, with an over Intenſe Affection, beyond their true Worth and Value. And ſo on the contrary, as to Hatred, the Carnal Mind hates that which he ſhould love, <hi>viz.</hi> God and Vertue, The <hi>Carnal Mind is Enmity againſt God, nor is it ſubject to the Law of God,</hi> Rom. 8.7. Or elſe he hates ſome Things as the chiefeſt of all Evils, <hi>viz.</hi> Sufferings and Afflictions, when indeed they are of that Nature, that upon due Conſideration a Man ſhall be able to ſay, <hi>That it is good for him, that he has been Afflicted.</hi> And accordingly when our Affections of either kind, are either <hi>miſplac'd upon wrong Objects,</hi> or are <hi>diſproportionate to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:151517:195"/> the true worth and Evil</hi> that is in thoſe Objects, towards which it is lawful to be well or evilly affected in Moderate Degrees. In either of theſe Caſes, I ſay, our Affections ſhall become ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh, and are neceſſary to be Renounced by us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And</hi> 1. <hi>Thoſe Affections of Love and Hatred muſt be utterly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd, which we ſhall find our ſelves to have miſ-plac'd upon wrong Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;</hi>

Thus muſt we not miſplace our Love upon that greateſt of all Evils, which is Sin.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>ſo</hi> 2. <hi>Inſtead of Hating God and Vertue, againſt whom the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nregenerate are at Enmity, we muſt Entirely and Affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately Love both,</hi> which is ſo plain and palpable a Truth, as needs nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proof nor Enlargement.

                  <p n="1">1ſt. We muſt not Love God with an inferior Degree of Affection, and Worldly Things with a Superior; but as God is the Supreme Good in himſelf, and the Author of all the Good we Enjoy, we muſt therefore Love him accordingly with the Intenſeſt Degree of Affection that we ſhall be able; ſo Matth. 22.37. <hi>Thou ſhalt Love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind.</hi> We muſt ſo Love him, as chearfully to Renounce and Sacrifice all our Profits and Pleaſures when call'd thereto; that is, <hi>We muſt deny our ſelves, take up our Croſs and follow him</hi> in Afflictions, Diſtreſſes, and Perſecutions, whenever the Croſs ſhall be laid upon us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.24. Nay, and we muſt ſo Love him, as even to <hi>Hate</hi> all others, the Neareſt and Deareſt Relations in compariſon of him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.26. So far muſt we Renounce our Affections of Love, as it is any wiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate to the thing Beloved, as it is too violently ſet upon pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and worldly Goods, and too cold towards God and Heavenly Things.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>And on the contrary we muſt alſo Renounce that other Affection of Hatred, as it is Diſproportionate to the Evil, which is to be Hated.</hi> There may be juſt occaſion of Anger towards a Perſon, and of Hatred of his ways, but we muſt not let thoſe Paſſions ſo far exceed their due Bounds, as to degenerate into Wrath and Malice. <hi>Let all Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, and Wrath, and Anger, and Clamour be put away from you, with all Malice; And be ye Kind one to another, Tender-hearted, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving one another, even as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven you,</hi> Eph. 4.31, 32.</p>

Even that Immoderation practiced by many in the Married State, there being a Chaſtity and Modeſty which ought to be preſerv'd, even in Wedlock it ſelf, which the Carnal part of Mankind may perhaps but little think of.</p>
                  <p>And indeed this Renouncing of theſe Fleſhly <hi>Luſts of Concupiſcence,</hi> is perhaps what the Compoſers of our Catechiſm (as taking the Form of Renunciation from the Ancient Baptiſmal Vow) did particularly intend; for as the Gentiles did ſcarcely make any account of Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor think it an Irregularity and Vice, ſo the Scripture, and the firſt Chriſtians, did particularly lay it upon all that ſhould take upon 'em the Chriſtian Name and Profeſſion, to <hi>Renounce</hi> thoſe kind of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Luſts. <hi>But Fornication and all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, let it not be once named amongſt you, as becometh Saints; for this know you, that no Whoremonger, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean Perſon hath any Inheritance in the Kingdom of Chriſt, and of God,</hi> Eph. 5.4, 5.

                  <p>And now I am only to ſhew you, that it is the proper Buſineſs and Employment of Religion, to Reduce Man, as far as is poſſible, in this State of Weakneſs and Infirmity, to his Primitive State of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and Integrity,<note place="margin">The Buſineſs of Religion is to reduce Man as near as poſſible, to his primitive State of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and Integrity.</note> to reſcue him out of Slavery, to reſtore him to himſelf, to put Right Reaſon and Religion again into the Throne, and to ſubject his Affections and Paſſions, his Luſts and Appetites, and every inordinate Inclination within him, to the Dictates and Laws thereof, refuſing to Gratify any of thoſe in any thing that is Sinful and Unlawful.</p>
                  <p>This is to wreſtle againſt Fleſh and Blood: And thus we muſt wreſtle, till we overcome, and bring it under, into an Entire Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to Right Reaſon, as ever we expect to be Friends of God, or ever hope to be <hi>Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more plain in Scripture, than the utter Inconſiſtency of a carnal Temper and Diſpoſition to a State of Grace and Reconciliation with God. <hi>The Carnal Mind is Enmity againſt God; for it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be;</hi> ſo that <hi>to be carnally minded is Death, but to be ſpiritually minded is Life and Peace,</hi> Rom. 8.6, 7. and therefore let me add with the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13, 14. <hi>Brethren we are Debtors, not to the Fleſh, to live after the Fleſh; for if ye live after the Fleſh, ye ſhall die; but if you through the Spirit do mortify the Deeds of the Body, ye ſhall live; for as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God,</hi> and ſo Heirs of Eternal Life; ſo neceſſary it is, as ever we expect the Favour of God, and future Happineſs, to ſubdue the Fleſh, and all its Luſts and Appetites, its Paſſions and Affections, all our fond and fooliſh Imaginations, and falſe Prejudices, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe within us which ſavours of Carnality, to the Power and Conduct of Right Reaſon, enlightned by the Word and Spirit of God.</p>

                     <hi>and in what Sence, and how far we muſt Renounce 'em ALL.</hi> And by Renouncing <hi>ALL</hi> the Sinful Luſts of the Fleſh, can be underſtood no leſs, than that we muſt Indulge no part, nor Faculty of our Corrupt Nature in the Tranſgreſſion of any of God's Commandments. All Men are not alike Addicted to Sin; but according as their Temper and Inclinations do differ, accordingly are they more or leſs given, ſome to one Vice, ſome to another. Thus ſome are Naturally High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, and theſe diſdaining to Think in the common Road, or to ſubmit their Judgments to commonly receiv'd Opinions, are always ſtarting new Notions, and broaching New <hi>Hereſies.</hi> Some again will be Orthodox enough in their Opinions; but being Perſons of warm Conſtitutions, and Sanguine Complections, they cannot help it they'll ſay, their being overcome by the Pleaſures of Senſe. The whole Herd of Unregenerate Sinners are not made up of ſuch as are all over wicked. But ſome are more particularly in their own Nature addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Covetous, ſome to Revenge, and others to Luſt, and the like. And then when theſe their Natural Diſpoſitions are ſtrengthen'd (as is uſual) by long Accuſtom'd Habits of Indulgence to ſome ſuch Complectional Vices; it becomes a very difficult Work utterly to <hi>Renounce</hi> ſuch Sinful Luſts of the Fleſh.</p>
                  <p>But however difficult it is, there muſt be no <hi>Indulgence</hi> to any one Fleſhly Luſt, nor muſt there be any Vicious Inclination ſuffer'd to Reign in us;<note place="margin">There muſt be no one fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Luſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to reign in us.</note> for <hi>the Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs of Men,</hi> Rom. 1.18.

                  <p>And indeed our Buſineſs is particularly to ſet our ſelves in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to thoſe Luſts, which ariſe from our particular Temper and Conſtitution,<note place="margin">Our Buſineſs is particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to oppoſe Luſts of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</note> and to ſubdue them: And alſo to break off thoſe Habits whereby theſe Natural Inclinations and Proneneſs to ſome particular Sins have grown ſtrong upon us. And this is that which is called, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.29, 30. <hi>A Cutting off the Right Hand, and a plucking out of the Right Eye;</hi> which Divorcing of our ſelves from our beloved Luſts, becauſe it is ſo difficult to go about, and ſo few have the Courage to do it effectually; it is therefore ſaid, That <hi>the Gate of Heaven is ſtrait, and that many of thoſe who ſhall ſeek to enter in, ſhall not be able,</hi> Luk. 13.24.</p>
                  <p>Now this is hard Doctrine to the Carnal Man,<note place="margin">This becauſe it is a hard Doctrine to the Carnal Man, is much Evaded.</note> who is Wedded to his Luſts, and has no mind to part with 'em. Such therefore are for it finding out all the Evaſions poſſible to ſhift off the Neceſſity of ſuch a ſorrowful Separation, as dreadful almoſt to 'em, as that of Soul and Body. And becauſe they find St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, (a Regenerate Perſon no doubt) owning that <hi>he found a Law, that when he would do good,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:151517:197"/> evil was preſent with him, and that he delighted in the Law of God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Inward Man; but that he ſaw another Law in his Members, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt the Law of his Mind, and bringing him into Captivity to the Law of Sin which was in his Members; ſo that with the Mind he did ſerve the Law of God, but with the Fleſh the Law of Sin,</hi> Rom. 7.21, 22, 23.25. Becauſe, I ſay, they find even St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſing himſelf, as they think, as unable to Reſiſt the Temptations of Fleſhly Luſts; and that all that he was able to do, was in his Mind and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to diſapprove of that which the prevailing power of Luſt within him, forc'd him to commit; They do therefore conclude, that provided it be with <hi>Reluctance,</hi> and ſome Counter-Strivings againſt their Luſts, that they do yield thereto; that they are in a Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate State, however, tho' in the Iſſue they do comply therewith; and conſequently that it is not of ſuch neceſſity to Renounce <hi>ALL,</hi> but that the inferior Appetites may be Indulg'd, what the Mind and Reaſon do ſqueamiſhly Refuſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Objection from <hi>Rom. 7.</hi> cleared.</note>But that you may not <hi>make Shipwrack of a good Conſcience,</hi> by falling into the uſual Miſtakes about the Sence of this place, you are to know, that St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s deſign in this 7th to the <hi>Romans</hi> being to Repreſent the Ill Condition of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as under the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which only Enlighten'd their Minds ſo far as to Convince 'em of many things to be Sins, which otherwiſe they could not have known to be ſuch; but gave no Power to 'em to overcome thoſe Luſts; becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> could not bear ſuch a Charge againſt themſelves and their Law, he does ſuppoſe himſelf in the caſe of a mere <hi>Jew,</hi> and Perſonating ſuch a One, does accordingly Argue as from Experience, againſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Power of the mere Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was deſtitute of thoſe Aſſiſtances afforded in the Goſpel. And this is a Scheme and Figure of Speech uſual with this Apoſtle in many other places. Thus <hi>for their ſakes he did transfer in a Figure thoſe things to himſelf,</hi> which could not be Perſonally ſpoken of him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. And nothing is more uſual than the ſame way of ſpeaking amongſt Men, eſpecially in Reproofs and ſuch Caſes, as would be ill Reſented, to be downright charg'd withal; but when we ſay, <hi>We do ſo, and ſo,</hi> under this diſguiſe it is uſual with more Succeſs, and leſs Offenſe, to diſparage and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect very ill Practices.</p>
                  <p>But that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould ſpeak it of himſelf, when he tells 'em, That <hi>he ſaw another Law in his Members, warring againſt the Law of his Mind, and bringing him into Captivity to the Law of Sin, which was in his Members; and that with the Mind he did ſerve the Law of God, but with the Fleſh, the Law of Sin,</hi> is contrary both to what he affirms elſwhere of himſelf, and of thoſe who are truely Regenerate. For of himſelf he affirms, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. <hi>That the Law of the Spirit of Life, had made him free from the Law of Sin and Death.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">We muſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Fleſh, and all its Sinful Luſts, ſo as to have an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, &amp; an Antipathy in our Hearts thereunto.</note> And <hi>ver.</hi> 1. he ſays of thoſe <hi>who are in Chriſt Jeſus, and to whom Condemnation does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,</hi> and who are conſequently Regenerate, <hi>that they walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi> And <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. it is ſaid, that <hi>they who are Chriſt's, have Crucified the Fleſh with the Affections and Luſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſhort therefore, and to draw towards a Concluſion, we muſt not content our ſelves in this great Work of <hi>Renouncing ALL the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Luſts of the Fleſh,</hi> that we have our Minds enlighten'd, ſo as to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:151517:197"/> know what we ought to do, whilſt our Affections and Bodily Powers do remain Rebellious againſt the Dictates of our Minds and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. But we muſt have our whole Natures poſſeſt with an Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, an Antipathy from the very Heart, againſt all Sin; and we muſt have both the Mind, Will and Affections, nay, the very Luſts and Appetites fully bent againſt it. And we muſt have, on the contrary, a hearty Love and Diſpoſition to all Vertue, wrought in all the ſame Faculties both of Soul and Body. We muſt be <hi>Renewed in the Spirit of our Minds, and put on the New Man, which after God is Created in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs,</hi> Eph. 4.23, 24.</p>
                  <p>And when a Perſon is thus inwardly Chang'd throughout, in all the Faculties and Powers of Soul and Body, it is then only that he can be truly ſaid to be <hi>a New Creature, a New Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this, indeed,<note place="margin">This the hard Part.</note> to become thus Renew'd in the Spirit of our Minds, ſo as to have the Heart and Affections ſet againſt Sin and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pleaſures, as well as the Mind convinc'd of the Evil of 'em, is the hard Work. This is certain, that it is not poſſible for any Man to work ſo great a Change in his Nature, of himſelf, but it is the Spirit of God that muſt aſſiſt wonderfully in the doing of it. And, indeed,</p>
                  <p>That we may be ſaid ſincerely and throughly to <hi>Renounce the Fleſh, and ALL its ſinful Luſts;</hi> that Renovation of our Corrupted Nature, wherein this Renunciation does conſiſt, muſt be ſuch as is wrought in us by the Spirit and Grace of God. This I ſay, becauſe it is very poſſible for a Man to be Chang'd from ſome ſenſual Courſes to an utter Hatred thereof, and yet remain in God's Eyes a <hi>Carnal and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nregenerate</hi> Man; and the reaſon is, becauſe his Change proceeds not from any Inward Vital Principle of Vertue, but from ſome prudential Methods in the management of his Pleaſures, as ſome the moſt ſenſual Epicures, that live, ſhall become at length temperate and ſober, becauſe their Conſtitutions will not bear a Debauch; but as the Spirit of God had nothing to do in the Change, ſo in their Hearts and Minds they remain ſtill to be ſenſual. And others again you ſhall meet, who have a full Conviction in their Minds and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, through the Preaching of the Word, of the Evil of Sin, and yet in their Affections they Love it, and their Luſts and Appetites Rebelling againſt the Reaſon of their Mind, will have it, and their Wills do finally chuſe it; ſo that theſe Perſons <hi>with the Mind do ſerve the Law of God, but with the Fleſh the Law of Sin;</hi> as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in that much miſtaken Chapter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.25. does repreſent, (as was now ſhew'd you) the Caſe of the Carnal Jew, abiding only under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the Law. But where the Spirit of God works the Change, that Perſon is <hi>Sanctify'd wholly, and the whole Spirit, and Soul, and Body will be preſerved Blameleſs unto the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.23. So that ſuch a Perſon ſhall effectually Renounce the Fleſh, and all its ſinful Luſts, both of the Inward, and of the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man.</p>
                  <p>And accordingly, as we will <hi>draw nigh to God, and have him draw nigh to us, we muſt cleanſe our hands, and purifie our hearts, and not be double-minded,</hi> Jam. 4.8. We muſt, through the Help of his Grace, <hi>Cleanſe our ſelves from all Filthineſs of
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:151517:198"/> Fleſh and Spirit, perfecting Holineſs in the Fear of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. We muſt be always, I ſay, in the perfecting of (one Degree after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) our Holineſs, and that Image of God which we loſt by our Fall; for the ſubduing of All our Luſts, muſt be the Work of Time; and it is not of a ſudden, that we can get an entire Conqueſt over 'em ALL. But if in our Strivings againſt 'em, we find our ſelves ſtill more and more to get ground upon 'em, we are in a hopeful Condition. In a Word therefore, <hi>Brethren, we are Debtors, not to the Fleſh, to live after the Fleſh; for if ye live after the Fleſh, ye ſhall die; but if through the Spirit ye do Mortify the Deeds of the Body, ye ſhall live; for as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God,</hi> Rom. 12.13, 14.</p>

The truth of it is, this Renouncing of the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil; that is, the Reſiſting, and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming of all their Numerous Hoſt of Temptations, is the Chriſtian's Warfare and great Work.

                  <p>The whole Bible, both Old and New Teſtament, is the proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of a Chriſtian's Faith; and whatever we find therein Recorded, or deliver'd down to us, we are to believe, as a Divine, Certain, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Truth, becauſe all things therein contain'd, are the Word of Him who will not, who cannot Lie, who neither can be deceiv'd himſelf, nor will he deceive others.</p>

                  <p>And ſo likewiſe as to the New Teſtament;<note place="margin">New.</note> Our Saviour upon his Entrance to preach the Goſpel, did in the firſt place require of all Men

All the parts of it are the Dictates and Word of God himſelf, and are more or leſs Uſeful to our Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Improvement in Divine Knowledge, Faith, and Practice. And therefore all Ranks and Degrees of Men, and of every Age, Young as well as Old, ought diligently to Study, and firmly to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Holy Scriptures. The <hi>Bereans</hi> did ſo, and they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the more Honourable for ſo doing. The <hi>Bereans were more Noble than thoſe in Theſſalonica, in that they Received, or Believed the Word with all readineſs of Mind, and ſearched the Scriptures daily, Act.</hi> 17.11. And it is Recorded to the Immortal Honour of <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 Epiſt. 3.15. <hi>that from a Child he had known the Scriptures, which were able to make him wiſe unto Salvation, through Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Some Truths Revealed in Scripture of greater Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and Concernment to us, than others.</note>Well, but tho' all Scripture, as being the Infallible Word of him, who neither can be deceiv'd himſelf, nor will deceive others, does Challenge the Belief of every Chriſtian; yet among the great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Truths of various Kinds deliver'd in the Scriptures, ſome are of far greater Importance and <hi>Concernment</hi> to us than others, becauſe they do more immediately and directly tend to give us due and worthy Apprehenſions of God, and to Inſtruct us in the only ſure Method of Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt. There are ſome Principal Doctrines of Chriſtianity, which are in their own Nature apt to have a greater Influence upon our Lives, and more powerfully to reſtrain us from a Courſe of Sin, and to unite us to the Practice of Vertue and Holineſs, than others; and when they have done this, to ſend us to God the Father to ſeek for Acceptance meerly through Chriſt his Son. And upon theſe, and the like accounts, therefore ſuch Truths as theſe are more particularly neceſſary to be Believ'd by us, in order to our Juſtification before God, and to our Salvation in the other World;<note place="margin">And muſt therefore be diſtinctly Known, and explicitely Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd</note> and are therefore called the <hi>Articles of our Chriſtian Faith,</hi> being a Summary and Collection of ſuch Doctrines out of the Holy Scriptures, as are of a more <hi>Concerning</hi> Nature than the reſt.</p>
                  <p>All thoſe other Truths, of what Nature ſoever, contain'd in the Holy Scriptures, are indeed neceſſary alſo to be Believ'd, at leaſt-wiſe <hi>Implicitely;</hi> that is, we are to be poſſeſt with a General Perſwaſion
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:151517:199"/> that they are all certainly true, becauſe God has Reveal'd them as ſuch. But theſe latter, which we call the <hi>Articles of our Chriſtian Faith,</hi> muſt be poſitively and <hi>Explicitely Believ'd,</hi> that is, we muſt throughly underſtand 'em, and be aſſuredly and diſtinctly perſwaded of each ſingle Truth contained in 'em, as without which underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and perſwaſion, a Good and Chriſtian Life will not be wrought in us, nor a reliance on God's Merits in Chriſt for the acceptance thereof, Created in our Souls.</p>
                  <p>Such, for inſtance, is the Belief that there is a God;<note place="margin">Some Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſuch Truths.</note> for this is the very firſt Principle of all Religion, and muſt neceſſarily make us ſtand in awe, and fear of offending him, if we throughly believe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it: Such is the Belief, that he is our Father who <hi>Created us and all the World;</hi> for this will make us love him who gave us our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And ſuch again is the Belief, that he Exerciſes a juſt and wiſe Providence in the Government of the World; for this will make us ſubmit our ſelves to all his Diſpenſations, as being the Appointments of One, who knows better than our ſelves what is Beſt for us.</p>
                  <p>And to inſtance alſo in ſome which are the Truths purely of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd Religion: Such is the Belief, that the Son of God came down from Heaven to ſuffer Death for us, to Redeem us from the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell; for this, as it ſhews us how Odious a thing Sin is, when nothing leſs could ſatisfy God's Juſtice againſt it, than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Blood of the Son of God; and conſequently, does extreamly tend to create in our Hearts an utter Hatred to all Sin: So hereby we are taught, that <hi>Chriſt has made a full, perfect, and ſufficient Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and Satisfaction for the Sins of the whole World.</hi> And ſuch, laſtly, is the Belief (for I need not now ſtand to mention every Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle) that all our Bodies ſhall riſe again at the General Reſurrection; that then we muſt all appear before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt, to Receive a Juſt Sentence for <hi>whatever we have done in the Body, whether it be good or bad;</hi> for this will make us careful how to lead our Lives ſo in this World, that we may not be Condemn'd in the next.</p>
                  <p>Theſe now are ſome of thoſe <hi>Articles of our Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and are ſuch Divine Truths, as are more particularly neceſſary to be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd by us, as containing in them the greateſt reaſon in the World to reſtrain us from all manner of Sin, and to encourage us in the Practice of all Religious Duties. And yet are Doctrines withal of extraordinary force, to remove all Conceit out of our Minds concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our own Merits, and to make us rely ſolely upon God's Mercies in Chriſt, for the Acceptance of our moſt Holy Performances. And let this ſuffice, as to the firſt Thing propoſed, which was to declare unto you ſomething in general, of the Nature of the Objects, or of thoſe Truths to be Believ'd <hi>the Articles of our Chriſtian Faith.</hi> And now,</p>

                     <note place="margin">Our Belief thereof muſt be Operative &amp; Practical.</note>I ſay, <hi>our Faith muſt be ſuch, as does Influence us to a Good Life;</hi> for ſuch is the Faith that St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us is now required in the Chriſtian Religion in order to Salvation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. <hi>In Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>neither Circumciſion availeth any thing, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion, but Faith which worketh by Love:</hi> Some render the words, and that more rightly, <hi>Faith that is perfected by Love;</hi> which does more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſignify the Apoſtle's meaning, that that Faith which will ſave us, muſt be ſuch as is perfected by the addition of thoſe Duties which we owe to God and our Neighbour. And St. <hi>James</hi> does with great Induſtry ſhew, that the Chriſtian Faith, which has the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Juſtification and Salvation, is a <hi>Powerful, Practical Belief,</hi> and that none other has any Promiſe. <hi>What,</hi> ſays St. <hi>James,</hi> 2.14. <hi>doth it profit my Brethren, tho' a Man ſaith, he hath Faith, and hath not Works, can Faith ſave him? Faith, if it have not Works, is dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone,</hi> ver. 17. and is no more than what the Devils have; <hi>for the Devils believe and tremble,</hi> ver. 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Such was the Faith of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and of all the Saints.</note>And the Faith, indeed, for which the Holy Patriarchs and Saints were Renown'd of Old, and are now ſo highly Rewarded in Heaven, was a <hi>Powerful, Practical,</hi> and Working Faith indeed, which exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to the higheſt and the hardeſt Acts of Obedience, that it was poſſible for Men to perform. Thus, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17, 18. we read, <hi>that by Faith,</hi> Abraham, <hi>when he was tryed, offered up</hi> Iſaac; <hi>and he that had received the Promiſes offered up his only begotten Son,</hi> and he a Son too in whom God had promiſed him great Bleſſings: And yet, at God's Command, he readily Obeyed, believing that God would be as good as his Promiſe to him, tho' it was by Raiſing him again from the Dead. <hi>By Faith,</hi> Moſes, <hi>when he was come to Years, refuſed to be called the Son of</hi> Pharaoh<hi>'s Daughter, chuſing rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of Sin for a ſeaſon, eſteeming the reproach of Chriſt greater riches than the treaſures of Egypt; for he had reſpect to the recompence of reward,</hi> ver. 24, 25, 26. It was a great Temptation to <hi>Moſes</hi> to be made a Prince, if he pleaſed, in which Eſtate he might enjoy the higheſt Pleaſures this World could afford; but he Believing, that God would infinitely reward him for his Self-denial, in refuſing ſuch Worldly Honours and Pleaſures, choſe rather to be one of thoſe mean Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted People, the Children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> By Faith, Thouſands of Bleſſed Saints before us, <hi>endured tryals of cruel Mockings and Scourgings, yea, moreover, of Bonds and Impriſonments; they were Stoned, they were Sawn aſunder, were Tempted, were Slain with the Sword, they wandred about in Sheep-skins, and in Goat-skins, being deſtitute, afflicted, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, (of whom the world was not worthy) they wandred in Deſarts, and in Mountains, and in Dens, and in Caves of the Earth,</hi> Heb. 11.35, 36, 37, 38. They were terrible Sufferings which the Servants of God in former times have been put to undergo; but as dreadful as they were, being ſupported with a firm Belief, that they ſhould be infinitely recompenced for their Sufferings and Loſſes, they thereupon chearfully underwent the ſevereſt, that the Wit or Malice of Men or Devils could invent or inflict upon 'em. Such a powerful, practical, working Faith indeed, was that for which the Holy Patriarchs and Saints were of Old Renown'd, and are now Rewarded in Heaven: A Faith, I ſay, which excited them to the higheſt and hardeſt Acts
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:151517:200"/> of Obedience, that it was poſſible for Men to perform. And ſuch a Powerful, Practical, Active and Working Principle is Faith, <note place="margin">And ſuch an Operative and Practical Principle is Faith, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved are of great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to us.</note> whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the things Believed are of great Importance or <hi>Concernment</hi> to us. <q>Some things indeed, as an Excellent Perſon does well obſerve, are of ſuch a Nature, that the Belief or Knowledge of 'em goes no farther, but reſts in it ſelf, as the Knowledge or Belief of bare Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative Truths, that do not at all <hi>Concern</hi> us; but ſome things again are of ſuch a Nature, as being once firmly and truly believ'd, and known, carry a Man out to Action.</q> Thus, for Example; If you ſhould hear another threaten'd, that he ſhould certainly be Kill'd if he ſtir out of his Houſe to morrow, it would not hinder you from going Abroad, tho' you firmly believe the Threatning, becauſe it is a Truth in which you are not <hi>Concern'd:</hi> But the Perſon ſo threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if he does throughly believe the danger, will certainly not ſtir out of his Houſe that Day, becauſe it is a Truth that he is very much <hi>Concerned in.</hi> On the other ſide, If you ſhall hear of a Promiſe made to another Perſon of a Thouſand Pound, if he will be at the Pains to go but to ſuch a Place, it will not make you go there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a Promiſe that you are not <hi>Concern'd in;</hi> but the other Perſon, if he be certainly perſwaded the Promiſe will be made good to him, will certainly go to the appointed Place, becauſe it is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that he is <hi>Concerned in.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo likewiſe, as to the Caſe in hand; That a ſure Promiſe of the Pardon of our Sins, and Eternal Happineſs, is made over to us in the Second Covenant, on Condition we will forſake the Service of Satan and of Sin, that we will Repent heartily, Believe practically, and Obey ſincerely, is a Truth that the Devils (to their great Grief) are fully perſwaded of; for they <hi>believe and tremble,</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> tells us: But this Faith of theirs, does not put them upon Repentance and Amendment, becauſe thoſe gracious Promiſes do not <hi>Concern</hi> them, and they have no Promiſe of Salvation, tho' they ſhould Repent and Amend. But as to us, whom they do <hi>Concern,</hi> and to whom they are made, if we are really perſwaded, that if we amend, we ſhall be certainly Saved, we ſhall immediately, upon ſuch Perſwaſion, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly Repent of what has been done amiſs heretofore, and take care to Obey God for the future; <hi>For every Man that hath this Hope in God, purifieth himſelf even as he is pure,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.3.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, the Articles of our Chriſtian Faith are every one of 'em ſo many Motives, and thoſe the moſt powerful ones in the World, to ſtir us up to a diligent Reformation of our Hearts and Lives. They are in themſelves the moſt obliging Arguments to it, and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to us, they are the moſt <hi>Concerning</hi> and Important Truths that can be, containing in the meaning of 'em, either Threatnings to ſcare us out of Sin, or Promiſes to allure us to Obedience: Either ſuch Conſiderations as are apt to excite our Fears when we are in a Courſe of Impiety, or are Grounds whereon we may build the vaſteſt Hopes in the Performance of our Duty. And if any One does not live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, <hi>a Godly, Righteous, and a Sober Life,</hi> I dare be bold to ſay, it is owing to ſome ſpice of Infidelity lurking in his Heart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is not throughly perſwaded of, or does not actually conſider theſe Truths; But he that does throughly Believe and Conſider them, can hardly fail of being a Good Liver. Thus neceſſary, you ſee it is,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:151517:201"/> that our Belief of all the Articles of our Chriſtian Faith be ſuch, as does Influence us to good Works; And then, after all,</p>

                        <hi>II.</hi> To Believe ſavingly, we muſt apply our ſelves to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, to intercede w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for our Gracious Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance.</note>II. <hi>It muſt be a Belief, that cauſes us to betake our ſelves to Jeſus Chriſt, to Intercede with God the Father for their Gracious Acceptance.</hi> This I have formerly, in the beginning of my Expoſition, inſiſted upon; yet ſuch is the growing Infidelity of the World with reſpect to this, which is the moſt Eſſential part of Chriſtian Faith, that it would not be unſeaſonable, ſhould I again ſhew you <hi>that we muſt depend upon the Mediation of Chriſt with the Father, for us, that our imperfect Righteouſneſs may be graciouſly accepted to our Juſtification.</hi> This is that Act of Faith which is called in Scripture <hi>Believing in Chriſt;</hi> and to ſuch a Believing as this it is, that our Juſtification is Attributed by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2.16. <hi>Know this, that a Man is not Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Works of the Law, but by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt; even we have Believed in Jeſus Chriſt, that we might be Juſtified by the Faith of Chriſt, and not by the Works of the Law, for by the Works of the Law ſhall no Fleſh be Juſtified.</hi> And as this Act of Faith, the <hi>Relying</hi> upon God's Mercies in Chriſt, does wonderfully exalt the Divine Juſtice and Mercy, ſo it leaves no place to the Creature to Attribute any part of its Happineſs to it ſelf, but does utterly exclude all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of Boaſting. <hi>God hath ſet forth Jeſus Chriſt his Son to be a Propitiation, through Faith in his blood, to declare his Righteouſneſs for the Remiſſion of Sins, that are paſt, through the forbearance of God. Where is Boaſting then? it is excluded. By what Law, of Works? nay, but by the Law of Faith,</hi> Rom. 2.25.27. So that it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that we Believe punctually, but it is moreover neceſſary that we rely alſo on God's Mercies in Chriſt, that our imperfect Holineſs may be accepted; or otherwiſe, even our Aſſent to all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith will not avail us to our Juſtification and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which brings me,</p>

To Believe <hi>ALL theſe Articles</hi> does Import, that we muſt Aſſent with a through Perſwaſion of their undoubted Truth, and of their Divine Authority, to all and every one of thoſe great Articles of Chriſtian Doctrine contained in the Apoſtle's Creed. This Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, or Summary of Chriſtian Doctrine, is called by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 6.17. <hi>That Form of Doctrine which was deliver'd to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;</hi> that is, that Summary of Chriſtian Doctrine, to the Belief and Practice of which they were deliver'd up, and ſolemnly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated in their Baptiſm.

                  <p>And as we muſt not ſhrink from the Confeſſion and Belief of any one of thoſe Articles, which have been Handed down to us from the Apoſtles, in that Summary, or <hi>Form of ſound words,</hi> which makes up the Body of our Chriſtian Faith; ſo we muſt content our ſelves with the Belief of <hi>All</hi> thoſe ſaving Truths, and muſt not think there is any thing more to be Believ'd by our ſelves, or others, as neceſſary to Salvation.</p>

Some of thoſe Articles in the Romiſh Creed, do plainly take away the neceſſity of a Good Life, as might be eaſily made appear, were it proper here to inlarge on that Point. And other Doctrines of that Church, do as apparently take Men off from depending ſolely upon the Mediation of Chriſt with his Father, that he would graciouſly accept and paſs by the Imperfection of the Good they do, teaching 'em to apply themſelves to the Bleſſed Virgin, and other Saints, as Mediators with God for 'em. Nay, and ſome of their Doctrines, as that of <hi>Merits,</hi> and of <hi>Works of Super-errogation,</hi> do teach 'em proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to over-value their own Performances, and to <hi>boaſt</hi> themſelves in their Merit. And therefore ſo far muſt we be from ſuffering our ſelves to be perſwaded of the Truth of <hi>All</hi> theſe, and the like Doctrines, as Articles of our Chriſtian Faith, that we muſt utterly diſſent from them all, as unjuſt and unreaſonable Impoſitions on the Belief of Chriſtians. In a word; as we muſt ſtrengthen our ſelves in the Belief of all thoſe True and Genuine Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, ſo to Believe all theſe, as neceſſary to Salvation, is enough. But to Believe more, under the Character of Articles of a Chriſtian's Faith, eſpecially if they be ſuch Doctrines as do take off the Fears of Sinning, and ſend us to <hi>other Mediators betwixt God and Man, beſides the Man Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> this is indeed a Belief, not only ſuperfluous, as being a Belief of more than <hi>All</hi> the neceſſary Articles of a Chriſtian's Faith, but is a very ſinful, and criminal, and ſuperſtitious Perſwaſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To Believe <hi>ALL the Articles</hi> of the Chriſtian Faith, is not only to aſſent to <hi>All,</hi> and every of thoſe Articles in the Groſs, <hi>but to be fully perſwaded of all and every of thoſe ſingle Truths contained in each of thoſe Articles.</hi>

Thus, for Inſtance, To believe that Jeſus Chriſt was <hi>Crucified, Dead,</hi> and <hi>Buried,</hi> does im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port this <hi>Comfortable,</hi> as well as <hi>Fundamental</hi> Doctrine of Chriſtianity, <hi>That the Only Son of God ſuffered Death upon the Croſs for our Redemption, and that he made there by that one Oblation of himſelf once offered, a full, perfect, and ſufficient Sacrifice, Oblation and Satisfaction for the Sins of the whole World.</hi> And accordingly it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. <hi>That Chriſt once ſuffered for Sins, the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God.</hi> And 21.24. it is ſaid, <hi>That he himſelf did bear our Sins in his own Body on the Tree.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then this is not the whole that is meant in that Grand Article, but alſo this other Doctrine, That he ſuffered to <hi>Redeem us from all Iniquity;</hi> that is, he ſuffered on the Croſs the Puniſhment of our Sins, that we ſeeing how odious a Thing Sin is, which could not be Atton'd for by a Sacrifice leſs valuable than the Blood of the Son of God, might therefore abhor it, and forſake it. And this is alſo taught us in the very place now cited from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> viz. 1 Epiſt. 2.24. <hi>He his own ſelf bear our Sins in his own Body upon the Tree, that we being dead to Sin, ſhould live unto Righteouſneſs.</hi>

And they are therefore Hereſies, becauſe they do ſo divide 'em, and do not each of 'em Believe both theſe important Doctrines. The <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians</hi> do Believe indeed, that Chriſt did ſatisfy the Divine Juſtice for our Sins, but ſo as to leave no Conditions to be perform'd by them.

And thus you alſo ſee, how you are to <hi>Believe All the Articles of your Chriſtian Faith;</hi> that you are not only to Believe every One of 'em, but all that Divine Truth which is contained in each.</p>
                  <p>And ſo, as I have before laid before you, how you are to Renounce the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh, ſo now, what it is to <hi>Believe all the Articles of your Chriſtian Faith.</hi> And ſo it only remains (and then I ſhall have fully Explain'd to you all the Conditions of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace) that I ſhew you next, what it is to Obey God's Holy Will and Commandments, and to walk in the ſame all the days of our Life.</p>

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:151517:203"/> Service of God, (oppoſite to all Hypocriſy, or a falſe and feigned Pretence of obeying Him, when in reality we only ſerve our own Selves, or our own Luſts and Intereſts.) Entire it muſt be, by being the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the whole Man, to the whole Will of God, and that at all times; with this abatement of Rigour, That all our unwilling and involuntary Failings, which, through Ignorance and Frailty, we commit, ſhall, upon our Prayers to God, and Charity to our Neighbour, be forgiven us; and even our wilful Tranſgreſſions, when we repent and forſake 'em, through the Mediation of Chriſt, and the Grace of the Goſpel, ſhall not be imputed to our Condemnation.</hi> Such is the Obedience which every one of you muſt carefully pay to the Holy Will and Commandments of God, as ever you hope to be <hi>Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> But for your better underſtanding the Nature and Extent of your <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Obedience,</hi> I will a little farther unfold each Part of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of it.

                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> Our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence must be ſincere, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a true and undiſſembled Service of God, oppoſite to all Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, or a falſe and feigned Pretence of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying Him, when in truth we ſerve our own ſelves.</note>I. <hi>Our Obedience to all the Laws of the Goſpel muſt be ſincere, by being a true and undiſſembled Service of God, oppoſite to all Hypocriſy, or a falſe and feigned Pretence of obeying Him, when in reality we only ſerve our own ſelves.</hi> This is a certain Truth, That our Gracious God, for the moſt part, hath made ſuch Things the Matter of His Laws, and of our Duty, as really make for our own Intereſt, Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Profit to perform; for ſo it really is to be <hi>Temperate,</hi> and <hi>Chaſte,</hi> and <hi>Contented,</hi> and <hi>Humble;</hi> to be <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright,</hi> and <hi>Charitable,</hi> and <hi>Peaceable,</hi> &amp;c. But then our Obedience is <hi>ſincere,</hi> and done as unto God, when we obſerve His Laws for His ſake, and becauſe He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it; for otherwiſe we do not obſerve <hi>God's Will,</hi> but our own: His Commands had no ſhare in what we did, becauſe it had been done although He had ſaid nothing. And thus <hi>ſincere</hi> muſt our <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> be unto God (as ever we expect that God ſhould Judge us at the laſt Day to have obeyed Him:) I ſay, it muſt be done as unto God; and ſincerely from our Hearts to pleaſe Him, and not only our ſelves. And this is plainly expreſſed in the very words of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, for it accepts not an heartleſs Service, nor accounts it ſelf obey'd by what was never intended for it: <hi>The Lord thy God requires of thee to ſerve him with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul,</hi> Matth. 22.36, 37. And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> does pray, that the <hi>Philippians</hi> may <hi>be ſincere</hi> in their Profeſſion, <hi>being filled with the Fruits of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> or Good Works, <hi>to the Praiſe and Glory of God,</hi> not themſelves, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.10, 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">God does not forbid us all intending our Advantage in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note>God indeed has not forbidden us all intending and deſigning of our own Advantage in the performance of his Commandments. When He requires us to obey Him, He doth not forbid us all Love of our Selves, and Regard to our own Self-intereſts: For why? He does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to us in Scripture the greateſt Rewards poſſible, as Motives to us, to perſwade us to obey. And the Bleſſed Saints in the Scripture, ſo Eminent for their Service to God, are ſaid to have had an <hi>Eye at the Recompence of Reward.</hi> But then our Intention of our own Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in God's Service is forbidden, and renders our obedient Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances corrupt and inſincere, when together with our Intention of ſerving God, we either join, firſt, another Intention of ſerving Sin: Or, ſecondly, when we deſign ſome temporal Ends, as much, or more, than we deſign God's Service.</p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:151517:203"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſay, That Man's Obedience is inſincere,<note place="margin">But 1ſt. that Man's Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, who to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his Intention of ſerving God, joins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sin.</note> 
                     <hi>who together with his Intentions of ſerving God, joins another Intention of ſerving Sin;</hi> as if a Man (as our Saviour tells us the Phariſees did) make <hi>long Prayers,</hi> and other Profeſſions of Religion, to enable him the better, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuſpicion, to <hi>devour Widows Houſes,</hi> as well as ſerve God. Where his obedient Performances ſlow from ſuch a mixture of Deſign as this, they will in no wiſe be owned as an obedient, but puniſhed as a ſinful Service.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Again, Men's Obedience is inſincere, <hi>When they deſign ſome temporal Ends in the Practice of Vertue, as much or more than they deſign God's Service;</hi> as when a Man is temperate,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> When he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns ſome temporal Ends in the practice of Vertue as much, or more than he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends God's Service.</note> and will not drink, which is his Duty indeed, but yet only becauſe he cannot without making himſelf ſick. But when, in the Performance of any Vertue, a Man has a regard as much, if not more, to his Profit or Eaſe, than to the Commands of God, in that caſe this Obedience is alſo <hi>inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,</hi> and will be far from entitling him to be an <hi>Inheritor of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven:</hi> For thus to have as much regard to our worldly Profit or Pleaſure, in the Performance of any Duty, as to pleaſe God, is a degrading of Him; it is a ſetting up the World for His Rival: And to bring other Things in Competition with Him, is plainly to Renounce him. In reſpect of our Love to God, we muſt even <hi>hate Father and Mother, Wife and Children,</hi> the deareſt Intereſts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns we have in the World. He will be ſerved and reſpected above all; for He is jealous of the Pre-eminence of His Service above all Things, as an Husband is of his Wife's Love to him above other Men: <hi>I the Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>am a jealous God,</hi> Exod. 20.5. And ſo much for that <hi>Sincerity</hi> which is required of us, as the firſt Qualification of an acceptable <hi>Obedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. That Evangelical or <hi>Goſpel-Obedience,</hi> which now,<note place="margin">2dly, Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience muſt be entire, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </note> under the Covenant of Grace, is the indiſpenſible Condition of every Man's Salvation, muſt be an <hi>entire Obedience to all the Laws of the Goſpel.</hi> Now this Integrity of our Obedience is ſuch a Perfection and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatneſs of it, as excludes all Maimedneſs and Defects; and this in another Word is ordinarily expreſt in Scripture by <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs,</hi> or <hi>walking uprightly.</hi> And to be upright in God's Ways, is not to ſtumble and fall by Sin or Diſobedience; but to be perfect and entire, or wanting nothing in obedient Performances.</p>
                  <p>And that our Obedience may be thus <hi>entire</hi> and <hi>upright,</hi> it muſt be, Firſt, The Obedience of the <hi>whole Man:</hi> Secondly, To the <hi>whole Law:</hi> And, Thirdly, perform'd <hi>at all times.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That our Obedience to the Laws of the Goſpel may be entire,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> The Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the whole Man; that is,</note> 
                     <hi>and ſo avail us to Life and Happineſs, it muſt be the Obedience of the whole Man;</hi> that is, we muſt take care to obey, with all the Powers and Faculties of our Nature: We muſt have our Underſtandings, our Wills, our Affections, and our Bodily Powers, obedient to God's Laws. And for this, the very Letter of the Law is expreſs; for when the Lawyer ask'd our Saviour, <hi>What ſhall I do to inherit eternal Life, Luk.</hi> 10.25. our Saviour ask'd, how it is written in the Law; who anſwering that it is written, <hi>Thou ſhalt love</hi> (that is, ſerve, as it is <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.13.) <hi>the Lord thy God with all thine Heart,</hi> or Will, <hi>with all thy Soul,</hi> or Affections, <hi>with all thy Strength,</hi> or Bodily Powers, <hi>and with all thy Mind,</hi> or Underſtanding, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26, 27. When the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:151517:204"/> Lawyer anſwered him, That thus indeed it was written in the Law (as it was <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.) our Saviour told him, he anſwered right; and bid him <hi>do this, and he ſhould live.</hi> Obedience, with all the Powers and with the whole Nature, is the Means of Life, and the indiſpenſible Condition of our eternal Happineſs. And,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">In the firſt place, of the Mind and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> We muſt keep all God's Commandments with our Mind, or Underſtanding; that is, all the Thoughts and Imaginations, all the Contrivances and Counſels of our Hearts, muſt be governed by, and kept in Obedience to the Laws of the Goſpel; ſo that we muſt not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge our ſelves, nor entertain in our Hearts evil Thoughts; wanton and vain Thoughts; nor muſt we purpoſe and contrive wicked and unjuſt Things, no more than we muſt outwardly act them. Thus the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. tells us, That <hi>the Weapons of</hi> a Chriſtian's <hi>Warfare,</hi> muſt be <hi>mighty through God, to the pulling down Strong-holds; to the caſting down Imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the Knowledge of God, and to the bringing into captivity every Thought to the Obedience of Chriſt.</hi> This Text forbids all Thoughts and Contrivances of Sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Secondly, of the Will.</note>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> As ever we hope to have our Obedience avail us to Life and Happineſs; as we muſt keep our Minds and Underſtandings, ſo likewiſe our Wills, in Obedience to God's Commands. The Choice, as well as the Practice of our Duty, is plainly neceſſary to render it available to our Salvation; but, on the other ſide, he that would ſin, if he could conveniently and opportunely; if he chuſe Sin, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he miſs of opportunity to act it; the bare Choice, without the Practice, is ſufficiently to his Condemnation. Thus our Lord Himſelf has determined it, <hi>Whoſoever looks on a Woman to luſt after her,</hi> or ſo long till his Heart eonſent to commit Lewdneſs with her if he could, though he never meet with an Opportunity to act it, <hi>hath committed Adultery with her already in his Heart,</hi> Matth. 5.28. This Text ſhews us, that we may diſobey in Willing, as well as Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that we ſhall be condemned for a wicked Choice, as well as a wicked Practice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Thirdly, of the Affections</note>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As we will render to God the Obedience of the whole Man, an <hi>entire Obedience,</hi> ſuch as will avail us to Salvation; we muſt regulate our Souls and Affections, conforming them wholly to what God Commands: That is, we muſt love our Duty, as well as do it; and not to do it meerly out of Fear, but out of Love. To pretend Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God, and yet to love what he forbids; to make a ſhow of his Service, and yet in our very Hearts to hanker after his vileſt Enemies, our Sins, whom above all Things his Soul hates; this ſurely is not honeſtly to Serve, but groſly to Collogue, and flatly to Diſſemble with Him. And we muſt not do our Duty meerly out of Fear, I ſay, but out of Love; for thus to ſerve God againſt our Wills, is to ſubmit to him, as a Slave doth to a Tyrannous Lord; not through any Kindneſs for him, but through a hateful Fear of him. But this is ſuch a hateful way of performing Obedience, as God will never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, nor accept of; for He ſcorns to be ſerved by a ſlaviſh Fear, and an unwilling Mind. <hi>No Man</hi> (as our Saviour ſays, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.24.) <hi>can ſerve two Maſters; for if he loves the one, he will hate the other: Ye cannot ſerve God and Mammon.</hi> By this he lets us know, that our Love and Obedience muſt go together, and be paid both to one God.</p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:151517:204"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> As we will give God the Service and Obedience of the whole Man, an Entire Obedience, ſuch as he will accept of to our Salvation, we muſt Obey him with all our Strength and bodily Powers: That is, we muſt not only Inwardly Approve of God's Commands as good in our Minds and Judgments, bear a Love to 'em with our Affections, and chuſe 'em with our Wills; but we muſt proceed Outwardly to Act, and do the Will of God in the Outward and Conſtant Practice of our Lives; we muſt put to our Strength and bodily Powers, and work the Will of God in our Lives and Actions. <hi>Little Children,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 Epiſt. 3.7. <hi>let no Man deceive you; he that doth Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is righteous:</hi> That is, you will be deceived, if you ſuffer others to perſwade you, or vainly flatter your ſelves, that there is any thing leſs than doing and acting vertuouſly and righteouſly, for which you ſhall be rewarded as vertuous and religious Perſons. Theſe Texts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many others, ſhew you the neceſſity, that our Inward good Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, proceed to Outward good Operations; that you muſt go on to do good Deeds, before you are fit for the Great Reward; that we muſt work, as well as deſire, and not only will and like, but do our Duty; becauſe on nothing leſs than that we ſhall at the laſt Day be accepted.</p>
                  <p>This indeed is the ſevere Service, and the diſtaſteful Part<note place="margin">This the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſteful part;</note> of our Duty. A ſecret Wiſh, or a ſudden Deſire of Obedience, may ſtart up in our Souls unawares; and there is not much oppoſition made to it, becauſe our Luſts receive no great hurt from it: And therefore they will allow us to think of Good, to ſpend a faint Wiſh, a ſudden Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or fruitleſs Deſire upon it; but if once we would go on to do our Duty, and to begin Obedience, then begins the Conflict; our Luſts then beſtir themſelves with might and main, and ſet every Faculty on work to reſiſt and defeat it; for our Thoughts then begin to argue and to pick Quarrels with our Duty, our Wills then begin to be averſe, and our Affections to cool towards it.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe in this Obedience of our Works and Actions,<note place="margin">And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured to be ſhifted off.</note> there is ſo much of difficulty, therefore are moſt People ſo deſirous to ſhift it off, and ſo forward to take up with any thing which will ſave them the labour of it: They perſwade themſelves, that God will admit of eaſier Terms; and build their Hopes on cheaper Services; as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, that it will be ſufficient to Salvation, that they <hi>Believe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi> and that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt died for them;</hi> that God will accept of the <hi>Will</hi> for the <hi>Deed;</hi> that God will excuſe their Diſobedience, becauſe when they fall, it is by reaſon of ſtrong and violent Temptations: And, laſtly, that it is not without Reluctancy and great Unwillingneſs that they diſobey. But all theſe are deceitful Imaginations; for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we are againſt Sin in our Thoughts, and Minds, and Deſires, the working Wickedneſs will make us, in God's account, Sons of Sin and Diſobedience, and will be ſure to render ſuch Children of Wrath and Deſtruction. <hi>If you live after the Fleſh,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, you ſhall die, Rom.</hi> 8.13. And whatever Men think in their Minds, or deſire in their Hearts, or profeſs in their Words to the contrary; if for all that they continue to commit Sin in their Actions, Chriſt has told them plainly, That he will pronounce (when he comes to ſit as Judge) <hi>Depart from me, all ye that work Iniquity,</hi> Matth. 7.23.</p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:151517:205"/>
                  <p>And thus you ſee what is, in the firſt place, neceſſary to make up an <hi>Entire Obedience;</hi> that our Obedience might be that of the whole Man; and that it may be ſuch, we muſt have our Minds, our Wills, our Affections, and, laſtly, our outward Actions, in Obedience to the Laws of the Goſpel; that all theſe ſeveral Powers muſt unite in God's Service, before it will be <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright</hi> and Compleat, ſuch as at preſent his Law requires, and ſuch as at the laſt Day he will accept of, and reward us for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> It muſt be an Obedience to to the whole Law.</note>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> As it is neceſſary to the <hi>Integrity</hi> of our Obedience, that we Obey his Holy Will and Commandments with our whole Man, with our Minds, our Souls, our Wills, and our Strength; ſo that we <hi>Obey his whole Law,</hi> and Conform our ſelves to every of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. We muſt not think to pick and chuſe in the doing of our Duty; for if we do not Obey all, we Obey not right in any; becauſe all the Laws of God are bound upon us by the ſame Power, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined by the ſame Authority: So that if we fulfill any one upon this account of his having required it; the ſame reaſon holds for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>This indeed is very hardly believed, becauſe it is ſo hard to practiſe; for almoſt every Man has ſome Sin or other, which he can as well Die as part with: It has got his Heart, and is become the Maſter of his Affections; and ſince he loves it ſo dearly, he hopes God will bear with it too.</p>
                  <p>And when Men are thus deſirous to Obey God by halves, and would hope that this might ſerve the turn, they take to themſelves falſe Grounds and Confidences, under which they ſhelter themſelves, in the allowance or indulgence of ſuch Sins, as they are reſolved to practiſe; and when they do wilfully continue in the practice of any Sin, they uſually plead one or more of theſe Things in excuſe:</p>

                  <p>Some indeed there are, who parcel out their time, and divide it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and their Sins; they obſerve a conſtant Courſe of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing and Repenting, of Sin and Sorrow; for they are always won when they are tempted, and they are always ſorrowful when they have done: And others there are, who wholly fall off at laſt, and ſin againſt God for altogether.</p>
                  <p>But now as for ſuch a broken Service as this is,<note place="margin">God will not endure a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sin and Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note> God will by no means accept of it: For when Chriſt comes to Judgment, he will paſs Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon Men according to what they are then, and not according to what they have been formerly. <hi>If the righteous Man turn away from his Righteouſneſs, and commit Iniquity, and do according to all that the wicked Man doth; Shall he live?</hi> No, by no means: <hi>For all his Righteouſneſs that he hath done formerly, ſhall not be mentioned; but in his Treſpaſs that he hath ſince treſpaſſed, and in his Sin that he hath ſince ſinned, in them ſhall he die,</hi> Ezek. 18.24. And it is they, <hi>which by patient continuing in Well-doing, ſeek for Glory and Immortality,</hi> that ſhall inherit <hi>eternal Life,</hi> Rom. 2.6, 7.</p>
                  <p>But as for all thoſe who fall off from a good Courſe, and turn Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates from Obedience, their Caſe is deſperate, and their Condition extreamly Damnable: <hi>For if after Men have once eſcaped the Pollution of the World, through the Knowledge of Chriſt's</hi> Goſpel, <hi>they are again entangled therein, and overcome;</hi> then is <hi>the latter End worſe with them than the Beginning,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.20.

Every Sin againſt Knowledge and Conſcience, is a wilful Sin, when our own Heart rebukes and checks us at the time of Sinning, telling us, that God hath forbidden that which we are about to do; notwithſtanding which, we preſume to do it. And as for them, they are all of an heinous Guilt, and of a <hi>crying Nature;</hi> ſuch Sins are a deſpiſing of God's Law, and therefore are call'd <hi>Preſumptuous Sins,</hi> and are ſaid to be acted through a Rebellious Pride, and with an high Hand, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.30.</p>
                  <p>And thoſe who have committed ſuch, are ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. <hi>to have done deſpight to the Spirit of Grace,</hi> becauſe as well the Spirit of God, as their own Reaſon have reſiſted 'em in the commiting of ſuch Sins, which Reſiſtance notwithſtanding they have violently broke through.
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:151517:206"/> And as to ſuch Sins therefore, they will make us the Children of Wrath, and ſubject us to Puniſhment, as well now, as under the Law, as is evident from that place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.28, 29. now mentioned: <hi>He that deſpiſed</hi> Moſes<hi>'s Law, died without Mercy; of how much ſorer pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, ſuppoſe ye, ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the Blood of the Covenant an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy Thing,</hi> (which they do who do wholly Apoſtatize) <hi>and hath done deſpite to the Spirit of Grace?</hi> which they do who do ſin wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
                  <p>And this they will be accounted to do, whether ſuch Sins be <hi>Direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and Expreſly wilful<note place="margin">Some Sins are directly and expreſly wilful.</note> and choſen, or only <hi>Indirectly</hi> ſo, and by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. Sometimes Men eye and view the Sin they are about to commit, before they chuſe or act; they pauſe and deliberate, doubt and demurr about it; they have a Conflict and Diſpute in their own Minds, whether they ſhould commit, or keep off from it: And when notwithſtanding this they commit it, that Sin is then directly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly choſen and wilful, and <hi>done in deſpite of the Spirit of Grace,</hi> and is therefore of a very heinous and damning Nature.</p>
                  <p>But beſides theſe,<note place="margin">Some indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> there are other ſinful Actions which are not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen directly and expreſly, but only <hi>indirectly,</hi> and by Interpretation; that is, when Men expreſly chuſe ſuch a ſtate of Things, as make ſome ſinful Action after that, to be no longer a matter of free Choice, but almoſt neceſſary and unavoidable. Thus he that wilfully drinks till he is Drunk, and then in his Drink commits Murder and Uncleanneſs, or any other mad Frolicks, or ſinful Extravagances, without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation or conſideration at all, ſhall nevertheleſs be judged to have wilfully committed thoſe Sins, becauſe he did deliberately and wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall into that Sin of Drunkenneſs, which when he was in (by depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himſelf of his Reaſon) made thoſe, or any other Sins, unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able at that time. So again, he that watches not over, but indulges and gives way to his Paſſions, and in his Anger kills a Man; and he that accuſtoms himſelf to a Sin ſo often, that he knows not when he commits it, as to ſwear, in either of theſe Caſes alſo, he ſhall be judged wilfully in God's account to have committed Murder, and to have ſwore; becauſe any Man may chuſe to indulge and humour his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or to accuſtom himſelf to that Sin, which makes his falling into other Sins ſo unavoidable. And, laſtly, he that wilfully neglects the means of attaining to any Grace or Vertue, will be judged wilfully to have <hi>omitted</hi> his Duty, which in the uſe of due Means he might have done acceptably. Thus in either of theſe Caſes, when Men fall into any Sin, either by Drunkenneſs, or by indulging, and not watching over their Paſſions; or by reaſon of having long accuſtomed themſelves to ſuch Sins; or, laſtly, by neglecting the Means of attaining to any Grace or Vertue: In any of theſe Caſes, he that commits a Sin, his Sin will be accounted as <hi>indirectly,</hi> and interpretatively choſen and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, becauſe he did willingly do thoſe things which brought and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd him into ſuch Sin; or wilfully neglected thoſe Means which would have preſerv'd him from them. And ſo his Sin will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, as a choſen and wilful Sin, and a Tranſgreſſion of God's Law, and he puniſhed as a wilfully Diſobedient Perſon. So that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Law and the Goſpel is not ſuch, as that wilful Sins

                  <p>And ſuch unchoſen and involuntary Sins, are thoſe which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit either through <hi>Ignorance,</hi> becauſe we did not underſtand our Duty; or through <hi>Inconſideration,</hi> becauſe we did not think of it. And unleſs our Ignorance and Inconſideration be themſelves wilful, we ſhall not be condemned for the Failings we have committed through either of 'em.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The firſt cauſe of an innocent Involuntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our Duty.</note>The firſt cauſe of an innocent and pardonable Involuntarineſs, is <hi>Ignorance</hi> of our Duty, when we do what God forbids, becauſe we do not know that He has forbid it; for ſuch Failings as we ignorantly commit, we ſhall not be condemned under the Covenant of Grace; for Chriſt, who is our High Prieſt, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us, <hi>will have compaſſion on the Ignorant, and them that are out of the way,</hi> Heb. 5.2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Provided it be not wilful.</note>True it is, there are thoſe that are wilfully ignorant; for either they ſhut their Eyes, and will not ſee their Duty, or they are idle and careleſs, and will not enquire after it: So that if they do not know their Duty, it is becauſe they do not deſire the Knowledge of it, or will be at no pains for it; they neither read the Word, nor come to hear it, nor to be Catechized; and if they do come, neither think nor conſider afterwards upon what they have heard; nor pray to God to make all thoſe Means of Knowledge effectual to their Salvation. And in the neglect of theſe Means of Knowledg, they make themſelves wilfully ignorant; and ſo their Ignorance will not be their Excuſe, but their condemning Sin, becauſe it was wilful and choſen. But if you have an honeſt Heart, deſirous to be taught, that you may know and do your Duty; and uſe an honeſt Induſtry, by Reading, coming to be Catechized, by conſtantly Hearing of the Word. If thus you do all that lies upon you to be informed what you ought to do, and yet afterwards, if through Miſ-underſtanding, you fail, then through the Grace of the Goſpel, and the Mediation of our Saviour, what you have been wanting in, will not be imputed to your Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> What you do unwillingly commit through <hi>Inconſideration.</hi> We ſometimes do things we do not think nor conſider the Evil of 'em when we commit 'em; and ſo their Sinfulneſs being unſeen, is alſo unchoſen; and theſe Slips do ſo ſteal from us, without our Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and thinking of 'em, ſeveral ways; either, firſt, by Surprize, and a ſudden Temptation.<note place="margin">Inconſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on excuſes, <hi>1.</hi> when through ſurprize.</note> And thus St. <hi>Paul,</hi> upon an unexpected occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, was ſurprized into a ſudden Anger, and into an unadviſed Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverence towards the High Prieſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.1, 2, 3. And the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of a ſingle Paſſion, whether of Anger or Envy, and the unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed Slips of the Tongue, generally enter this way. Or, ſecondly, we venture upon ſeveral Actions without thinking of their ſinfulneſs, through our natural Wearineſs, and the length and conſtancy of a
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:151517:207"/> Temptation. Thus in times of Affliction, or Sickneſs,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>2.</hi> When thro natural wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs, and the length and ſtrength of a Temptation.</note> by the unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the Fleſh, and the hardneſs of a Man's Condition, a Perſon is ſometimes tempted to fret and murmur, and to be peeviſh and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining: And ſo we find it was with <hi>Job,</hi> who though a Man patient to a Proverb, and one to whom, by the Teſtimony of God Himſelf, <hi>there was none Equal in the whole Earth, a perfect and an upright Man, one who feared God, and eſchewed Evil,</hi> Job. 1.8. Yet this Man, I ſay, of admirable Conſtancy and Patience, was wearied out of his Watchfulneſs, by a tedious trial of Afflictions; and in that time of his Unadviſedneſs, uttered many things impatient with his Lips, as appears from his whole Hiſtory. And, laſtly,<note place="margin">Laſtly, When by the violent diſcompoſure of our Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Powers, our Minds are ſo diſturbed, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think what we do.</note> we ſometimes inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately and unadviſedly do an ill Thing, by reaſon of the violent Diſcompoſure and Diſturbance of our thinking Powers, when our Mind is ſo diſturbed, that on a ſudden we cannot think what we do; as upon a ſudden Grief, Anger, or Fear. And thus <hi>Samuel,</hi> who was a Perſon ſo dear to God, that if he could be intreated by any Man, he tells us it would be by him, or <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſtanding to intercede before him; did yet in an inſtance that would have drawn him into the hazard of his Life, diſpute God's Command, when he ſhould have perform'd it, and queſtion where in Duty it became him to Obey; for when God did bid him go and Anoint <hi>David</hi> King, which Service was ſure to draw upon him the implacable Hatred of <hi>Saul;</hi> through the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den force of that frightful Thought, inſtead of Obeying, he anſwers again, ſaying, <hi>How can I go? for if</hi> Saul <hi>hear of it, he will kill me,</hi> 1 Sam. 16.1, 2. So that as for thoſe Slips, which we do unwillingly commit, through either of theſe Cauſes of <hi>Inconſideration,</hi> they are a matter of God's Mercy, and will be graciouſly born with, and forgiven now under the Goſpel and <hi>Covenant of Grace;</hi> for all thoſe Perſons now mention'd, as guilty of the like, St. <hi>Paul, Job,</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> were in a State of Grace, and the dear Children of God; I ſay therefore, they will be graciouſly born with, and forgiven.</p>
                  <p>Provided, firſt, we never be guilty of 'em,<note place="margin">Ignorance &amp; Inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion excuſe not theſe Sins, <hi>1.</hi> Which we have time to underſtand and obſerve; nor, <hi>2.</hi> Crying Sins; nor, <hi>3.</hi> Thoſe we do not endeavour againſt; nor, laſtly, Which we are not ſorry for.</note> when we have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of, and time to obſerve 'em, nor, ſecondly, in any great and crying Sin, as <hi>Murder, Adultery,</hi> &amp;c. for no Man can pretend he did unwittingly commit ſuch things, as a Man's Conſcience will preſently ſtart at: Provided, thirdly, we do endeavour and ſtrive, and watch againſt'em: And, laſtly, after we find that we have fallen into'em, provided we be ſorry, and earneſtly beg God's Pardon for 'em. Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thus, ſuch Slips and Infirmities, as we do commit unadviſedly and inconſiderately, ſhall not be laid to our Charge.</p>
                  <p>And thus you ſee, that our <hi>unavoidable</hi> Infirmities, and our <hi>unwilling</hi> Tranſgreſſions, which through an unaffected <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and an involuntary <hi>Inconſideration,</hi> we do commit, ſhall not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to our Condemnation now under the Goſpel, or Covenant of Grace.

                  <p>Among the <hi>Jews,</hi> according to the ſtrictneſs of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, the Puniſhment took place upon the firſt wilful Breach: <hi>He that deſpiſed</hi> Moſes<hi>'s Law,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, if it were in an inſtance where the Law threaten'd Death, <hi>died without Mercy,</hi> Heb. 10.28.

                  <p>But when Chriſt came into the World, his Buſineſs was to abrogate all the Rigour of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, as well as that of the <hi>Firſt Covenant,</hi> and to Preach an Univerſal Pardon upon Repentance. Now under the Covenant of Grace, God doth not caſt us off upon the Commiſſion of every Sin, but as he is heartily deſirous that we ſhould repent of it, according to that of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, I do not delight in the death of a Sinner, but rather that he return, and live.</hi> So when we repent, he has oblig'd Himſelf, by his Truth and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, to forgive it, according to that of St. <hi>John,</hi> Epiſt. 1.9. <hi>If we confeſs our Sins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our Sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Remiſſion of Sins upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, the great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel.</note>This is the great Doctrine of the Goſpel, which is a Covenant of Remiſſion of Sins upon our Repentance; and therefore our Saviour, when he began himſelf to Preach it, he ſaid, <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand,</hi> Matth. 4.17. And when he left the World, he commanded his Diſciples, that they ſhould declare to the World the Pardon of Sins upon their Repentance; for ſo St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, <hi>Ch.</hi> 24.47. that he gave 'em in Charge, <hi>That Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins ſhould be preach'd in his Name to all Nations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus has God provided us of Means, which will moſt certainly reſtore us to his Favour. He has not left us in a forſaken State, but has preſcribed us this Method of Repentance to recover us out of it,<note place="margin">Repentance will be acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to our pardon, for our known or ſecret Sins, whether wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully or unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but now forgot, though gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally repented of.</note> and to be the great Inſtrument of our Pardon and Reconciliation. And our Repentance, through the <hi>Mediation of Chriſt,</hi> will be accepted for our Pardon, whatever our Sins have been, whether known or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; whether they have been wilful or involuntary Sins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Our unknown, or ſecret Sins, which whether wilfully or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly we have committed, but now we have forgot, ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given us upon our hearty, though general Prayer to God to forgive us; ſuch as was that of <hi>David, O cleanſe me from my ſecret Faults, Pſal</hi> 19.12. and upon our diligent care hereafter, not knowingly and wilfully to tranſgreſs any of God's Laws. And,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our moſt unknown and wilful Sins, even they ſhall alſo be forgiven us, if for every particular Sin we know our ſelves to have committed,<note place="margin">

                  <p>'Till we are reclaim'd indeed from our former Sins, and are become God's dutiful Sons and faithful Servants for the preſent, and for the future; it is not conſiſtent with the Honour of his <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
                     <pb n="265" facs="tcp:151517:208"/> with the <hi>Authority</hi> of his Laws, and with the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of his Government, to receive us into his Favour: But as ſoon as ever we are conſcientiouſly reform'd from our Sins, he will be reconciled to us, if we are heartily ſorry for what has been paſt, and amended for the future; and in caſe of Injury or Wrong done to God or Man, we undo, as much as in us lies, what has been done amiſs, by making amends, and reparation for what we have injured either.</p>
                  <p>We cannot be ſaid to repent of a Sin, unleſs <hi>we undo,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">And in caſe of Injury to Man, if Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution be made.</note> 
                     <hi>as much as in us lies, what has been done amiſs:</hi> Therefore if any one has offended his Neighbour, and given him juſt cauſe of Anger againſt him; he that will truly repent, and expect that God will hear his Prayers for his Pardon, muſt go and acknowledge his Offence, endeavour to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe his Neighbour, and be reconciled to him; for ſo our Saviour has ordered, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.23. <hi>before</hi> he offer his Prayer to God. And he that has injured his Neighbour, either by taking away his good Name by Slander, or his Goods by wrong Dealing, muſt take off the Slander, and reſtore what he has unjuſtly got; and ſo did good <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus,</hi> upon his Repentance, we find, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.8. when he embraced the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>And ſo likewiſe towards the <hi>Reparation</hi> of God's Honour,<note place="margin">Of high Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor to God and Religion, if that be not repair'd by an eminent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</note> I muſt needs add, as a neceſſary part of Repentance, that he who has former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly liv'd a very notorious and ſcandalouſly ill Life, to the great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of God and Religion, muſt now, towards the Reparation of God's Honour, be as famous for his eminent and exemplary Piety, that his Repentance may be accepted, a private Sorrow for publick Scandals falling vaſtly ſhort of <hi>undoing what has been done amiſs,</hi> in which conſiſts the reſtitutive part of Repentance. The neceſſity of this, we have exemplified in the caſe of the Woman <hi>who waſhed our Saviour's Feet with her Tears, and wiped them with the Hair of her Head,</hi> Luke 7.44. She had formerly, it ſeems, been a very vile Woman; but the reaſon why <hi>her Sins, which were many, were forgiven,</hi> is ſaid by our Saviour to have been, becauſe ſhe <hi>loved much,</hi> verſ. 47. And thus if we do repent, our Sins ſhall not be imputed to us; but through the Merits of Chriſt's Death, and the Grace of the Goſpel, they ſhall be looked upon as if they had never been.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have ſhewed you, that other great Difference betwixt that Obedience required now under the Covenant of Grace, and the Obedience required by the Firſt Covenant; That whereas the Obedience required by the Firſt, was a <hi>Perfect, Exact, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſinning Obedience,</hi> the never Offending at all. Now not only our involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Sins and <hi>Infirmities;</hi> but alſo our moſt voluntary and wilful Tranſgreſſions, when by Repentance we bewail and forſake 'em, and take better care to avoid 'em for the future; they alſo, through the Mediation of Chriſt, according to the Terms he has obtain'd for us in the Covenant of Grace, ſhall be forgiven us, and not prejudice our being <hi>Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And upon the whole, I have now ſhewed you,<note place="margin">The ſumm of Evangelical Obedience.</note> as to all that Obedience required now under the Goſpel, to make us <hi>Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> that there is not required indeed, a Perfect, Exact, Unſinning Obedience, the never offending in any one part, which was the indiſpenſible Condition of the Firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:151517:209"/> but there muſt be a Sincere and Entire Obedience paid to all the Laws of the Goſpel: Sincere it muſt be, by being a true and undiſſembled Service, Obeying 'em not only becauſe moſt for our Health and Intereſt, as generally the Laws of Religion are; but even where they are contrary to our Inclinations and Intereſt, becauſe God commands us. And Entire it muſt be, by being the Obedience of the whole Man, of our Underſtanding, our Wills, our Affections, and our Actions, to the whole Law of God, and that at all times. And this if we endeavour the beſt we can to do, that our unwilling and involuntary Failings, which through <hi>Ignorance</hi> and Frailty we commit, ſhall, upon our Prayers to God, be forgiven us; and that our wilful Tranſgreſſions, when we repent of, and forſake 'em, through the <hi>Mediation of Chriſt,</hi> and the Grace of the Goſpel, ſhall not be imputed to our Condemnation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The ſumm alſo thereof, according to Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</hi>
                     </note>In a word: That Obedience (to ſpeak alſo in the Words of the Learned Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>) which is the Condition of the <hi>Second Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> and of our being made <hi>Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> Negatively it is not a Perfect, Exact, Unſinning Obedience, the never offending at all in any kind of Sin, (this is the Condition of the Firſt Covenant.) Nor, ſecondly, is it never to have committed any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate Sin in the former Courſe of our Lives. Nor, thirdly, never to have gone on, or continued in any habitual or cuſtomary Sin for the time paſt: But it is poſitively the <hi>New Creature,</hi> or Renew'd, Sincere, Honeſt, Faithful Obedience to the whole Goſpel, giving up the whole Heart unto Chriſt, the performing of that which God enables us to perform, and bewailing our Infirmities, and Frailties, and Sins, both of the paſt and preſent Life, and beſeeching God's Pardon in Chriſt for all ſuch, and ſincerely labouring to Mortify every Sin, and to perform an uniform Obedience to God, and from every Fall riſing again by Repentance. And thus, if we Obey God's Holy Will and Commandments, and Walk in the ſame all the Days of our Life, we ſhall not fail to be <hi>Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus I have fully Explain'd to you all the Conditions of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> both on God's Part, and on ours; both what it is to be a Member, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the Mercies and Favours made over to us therein on God's Part, and what it is to Renounce the Devil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the Conditions to be perform'd on ours.</p>
                  <p>My next Task muſt be, (and then I ſhall give you a full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all that pertains to the Nature and Subſtance of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace) to ſhew you, what a happy State of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this is, to be in ſuch a Gracious Covenant with GOD; By whoſe Mediation we obtain'd it; By whom and how we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into it: And, laſtly, what infinite Thanks we owe to God for Calling us into this State of Salvation: All which Points we have taught us in theſe Words: <hi>And I thank God our Heavenly Father, that he hath called me to this State of Salvation, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi>

                     <hi>THE XXIV. Lecture.</hi> And I heartily thank our Heavenly Father, that he hath called me to this State of Salvation, through Ieſus Chriſt our Saviour.</head>
                  <p>I Have already, in order to a full Explication of all that pertains to the Nature of the Covenant of Grace, given you an account of the Terms and Conditions of it, both on God's part and on ours, as they are laid down and taught you in your Church-Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm.</p>
                  <p>The invaluable Priviledges on God's part, made over to you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as you are taught in your Catechiſm, and I have explain'd 'em to you are, firſt, That you are therein <hi>made Members of Chriſt;</hi> ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Children of God;</hi> and, thirdly, <hi>Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And thoſe Conditions to be performed by us, our part of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, are, That we ſhould, <hi>firſt, Renounce the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh. Secondly, That we ſhould believe all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith.</hi> And, <hi>Thirdly, That we ſhould keep God's Holy Will and Commandments, and walk in the ſame all the days of our Life.</hi> And what each ſeveral Article in this your gracious Covenant doth mean and import, I have hitherto (according to the beſt of my Skill) been explaining to you.</p>
                  <p>And now, if there be any thing farther neceſſary to a full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Explication of the Nature of this Covenant, it muſt be this, in the ſecond place, to ſhew you, <hi>How that thereby you are reſtored to a ſtate of Salvation:</hi> Thirdly, By whoſe Mediation you obtained ſo gracious a Covenant, and are put thereby into a ſtate of Salvation; <hi>It was through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi> Fourthly, By whom and how we have been Call'd to this ſtate of Salvation; It was <hi>our Heavenly Father, who hath called us to this ſtate of Salvation, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi> And, laſtly, What infinite reaſon you have <hi>heartily to thank Almighty God our Heavenly Father, that he hath Called you to this ſtate of Salvation, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And I heartily thank our Heavenly Father, that he hath Called me to this State,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:151517:210"/>
                  <p>And as all theſe Points are fairly taught you in theſe Words of your Catechiſm; ſo in commenting upon theſe, I will, by God's Aſſiſtance, open and explain theſe ſeveral Points to you. To proceed therefore, in order to a more compleat underſtanding of the whole Nature of the Covenant of Grace, let us ſee,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> How this Covenant, whoſe Terms and Conditions I have been explaining to you, <hi>does reſtore us to a State of Salvation.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">That in the Covenant of Grace, we are reſtored to a State of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does import a Deliverance from Danger or Miſery; and a <hi>State of Salvation</hi> does import the being put into a Condition of Safety, where one may be ſafe and ſecure from Danger and Miſery, if he pleaſe. For our underſtanding therefore, how this Covenant of Grace is a means of reſtoring us to a State of Salvation, we muſt look back and conſider, how we brought our ſelves into a State of Danger and Miſery before; and how by the Covenant of Grace we are put again into a State of Safety and Security, if we pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">How we brought our ſelves into a ſtate of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery before.</note>And to this purpoſe we muſt know, That God Almighty created Man at firſt in ſuch a ſtate of Perfection, with ſuch an enlightned Mind, ſuch a regular Will to the Laws of right Reaſon, and with ſuch obedient Appetites and Affections, that he might, if he would, have continued in perfect Innocency: And now making him thus upright, and capable to perform ſuch an Obedience, God did very reaſonably make this Covenant with Man, That he ſhould perform a <hi>Perfect, Exact, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſinning Obedience,</hi> and live for ever: But upon the leaſt Sin, the eating of the Fruit of one Forbidden Tree, he ſhould ſurely Die. The Event of which Proceeding was, that Man hearkning to the Suggeſtions of the Devil, did thereby Rebel againſt his Maker, take part with Satan, and ſo did forfeit all his Right and Hopes of Happineſs; which upon the faithful Performance of his Covenant he would have had, was ſhut out of Paradiſe, and condemn'd to Death, as you will ſee largely deſcribed in the Third Chapter of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> Thus did Man, by the breach of his Covenant with God, bring himſelf into a ſtate of Danger and extream Miſery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">How by the Covenant of Grace we are put into a ſtate of Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, if we pleaſe.</note>And now here it comes in for us to conſider the Second Covenant, as that which reſtores us to a <hi>State of Salvation.</hi> Had the Firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained uncancelled, and in full force, we muſt have all periſhed without remedy, upon a double account: It required an unſinning Obedience, and we had ſinned: It allowed no place for Repentance after Sin, and yet we had brought our ſelves into that State, that <hi>except we ſhould repent,</hi> and our Repentance be accepted, <hi>we muſt all undoubtedly have periſhed.</hi> We were unavoidably therefore bound up by that <hi>Firſt Covenant,</hi> as the caſe then ſtood with us, to Death and Miſery; and it was not poſſible for the Wit of Man to contrive any way to eſcape it.</p>
                  <p>And now when we were in this irrepairable State, was God of his own Goodneſs graciouſly pleaſed to <hi>cancel the Firſt Covenant, blotting out the Hand-writing of Ordinances that was againſt us, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to the Croſs of Chriſt,</hi> Col. 2.14. By which place is more immediately meant, I muſt confeſs, his <hi>cancelling</hi> and making void, as to any condemning Power in it, the Covenant of Works made with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by the hand of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> but not ſo as to exclude his cancelling all former Covenants that were too rigorous and impoſſible for Man in his <hi>fallen State</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:151517:210"/> I conclude therefore, that God was graciouſly pleaſed to <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel</hi> and make void the <hi>Firſt Covenant,</hi> under which Man was created, and which he was uncapable of performing and receiving Benefit by, having forfeited that perfect Light, and perfect Strength, which ſhould enable him to perform it, and become very defective and weak both in Knowledge and Ability of performing his Duty towards his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. And he was pleaſed to grant unto us, and to eſtabliſh with us a <hi>Second,</hi> by way of Remedy againſt the Rigour and Extremity of the <hi>Firſt;</hi> wherein God, as it were, deſcending from his Majeſty and Glory, does oblige himſelf to make good to ſuch, as ſhall enter into it, and continue faithful therein, thoſe ineſtimable Favours and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which do vaſtly exceed thoſe of the former. For, in the firſt place, whereas the Firſt Covenant did not (as far as I can find in Scripture) any where <hi>Expreſly</hi> promiſe Eternal Life in Heaven, to thoſe that were faithful in it: The <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> whereunto you are called, does, in innumerable places, propoſe immortal Life and Happineſs, to all thoſe that do <hi>Believe</hi> its Doctrines and Articles, and do ſincerely Obey its Precepts, as has been ſhewed you; for it is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt who hath brought Life and Immortality to light, through the Goſpel,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.10. And then, ſecondly, whereas under the Firſt, there was no place for Repentance; but nothing leſs than an Exact and Unſinning Obedience, was the Condition of this Life and Happineſs: And upon the firſt and leaſt Offence, all was become forfeit and loſt. Herein we have this relaxation of Rigour, and exceeding Favour, That even the greateſt Sinners, upon their Repentance and Return to God, ſhould be ſaved; and our Saviour therefore left Commiſſion with his Diſciples, That <hi>Pardon and Remiſſion of Sins ſhould be preached in his Name, amongſt all Nations,</hi> Luk. 24.47. Thus, in the Covenant of Grace, is Repentance, like a Plank thrown out, which if Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack'd Sinners lay hold on, they may ſave themſelves; and the Covenant it ſelf like a Ship, like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark, whereinto thoſe that enter, and will continue in it, may be landed ſafe in the Kingdom of Heaven. So that the Covenant of Grace, in whoſe Terms and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions you have been lately inſtructed, does reſtore us you ſee into a ſtate of Salvation, whereby we are put again into a ſtate of Safety and Security, if we pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>And now, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it will be infinitely worth our Enquiry,<note place="margin">That by the Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt it was, that we obtained ſuch a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Covenant, whereby we are reſtored to a ſtate of Salvation.</note> by whoſe <hi>Mediation</hi> we obtain'd ſuch a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored thereby into a ſtate of Salvation. And it was <hi>through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi> You have ſeen how wretchedly Man did break his Covenant with his Maker, and into what a miſerable State he plung'd himſelf thereby.</p>
                  <p>And now behold the unſpeakable Goodneſs of God the Father Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, declared in Jeſus Chriſt his Son! When God's Juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that Sin ſhould be puniſh'd; when his Holineſs forbid, that a thing ſo contrary to his Nature, and hateful unto him, as Sin is, ſhould eſcape the ſevereſt Marks of his Diſpleaſure, and when his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom would not ſuffer it to eſcape Puniſhment, leſt his Creatures ſhould take occaſion from thence to Rebel the more againſt him; when for theſe Reaſons it was neceſſary that the Sin of Man ſhould be moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſh'd; then did Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God interpoſe Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:151517:211"/> betwixt Vengeance and us, and did mediate and intercede with his Father, to pardon and forgive us the Breach of our Covenant, he laying down his own Life a Ranſom for our Sins, to redeem us from Miſery, and paying his own Blood a Satisfaction for our Offences: This we have taught us, 1 Tim. 2.5. <hi>There is one Mediator betwixt God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a Ranſom for all.</hi> And, moreover, becauſe having fallen from our Uprightneſs, and loſt that perfect Light and Strength, whereby, in a State of Innocence we had been able to perform a perfect, exact, and unſinning Obedience, the Conditions of the Firſt Covenant; becauſe this we were no longer able to do; and therefore ſo long as we remained bound to perform the Firſt Covenant, we muſt have been however loſt; Jeſus Chriſt did therefore, I ſay, moreover mediate and intercede with his Father in our behalf, and purchaſing the Grace and Favour with his precious Blood, did obtain for us a better Covenant, a Second and more Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Covenant, inſtead of the Firſt, which was more Rigorous; a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant conſiſting of ſuch Conditions, as by his Grace we ſhall be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabled to perform, and of far better Promiſes to encourage our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours and Performances; for which reaſon he is therefore ſtyled the <hi>Mediator of a better Covenant, which was eſtabliſhed upon better Promiſes,</hi> Heb. 8.6.</p>
                  <p>In particular, He did obtain theſe infinitely happy Terms and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for us (as has been already ſhewn you) that if we would renounce God's Enemies, the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, and return to our Obedience (which is in other Words to Repent) we ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as <hi>his Children,</hi> and have all our former Rebellions pardoned us: That if we will firmly and practically <hi>Believe</hi> in God, and in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who died and ſuffered for us, we ſhould be <hi>Members of his Body, the CH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RCH,</hi> and partake of all thoſe manifold Graces and Priviledges he has Purchas'd for it. And laſtly, if inſtead of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, exact, unſinning Obedience, we would but perform a <hi>Sincere</hi> and Honeſt one, ſuch as, by the Grace he would afford us, we ſhould be enabled to, we ſhould finally be made <hi>Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Thus did Jeſus Chriſt mediate and intercede with God the Father for our Pardon, upon the Breach of the Firſt Covenant, paying down his own Life a Satisfaction for the Injuſtice done by us to God, in violating of it, and did purchaſe and procure of God the Father, to be reconciled to us upon eaſier Terms, ſuch as thoſe in the Covenant of Grace now mention'd.</p>
                  <p>And now let us behold here, and admire the infinite Wiſdom alſo, as well as Goodneſs, in this Method of our Redemption, through and by the Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour. Was it neceſſary, as a due Reparation of God's Honour, that the Divine Juſtice muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for the Breach of the Firſt Covenant? Who then could be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for ſo vaſt an Undertaking, except the Son of God, who is God Himſelf! The Sufferings of ſuch a Perſon, as a Satisfaction to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice, could alone fully proclaim the infinite Guilt of Sin; and, How extreamly God was incens'd againſt it, and could alone ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pacify and attone the Divine Anger thereupon! Was it, again, on the other ſide, requiſite to Man's Reſtoration, that a Covenant ſhould be obtained of ſuch Conditions, as we in our ſtate of Weakneſs might be capable of performing? Who then was ſo proper to propoſe to,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:151517:211"/> and obtain of the Father ſuch gracious Terms for us, as one who was himſelf Man, and ſo could be ſenſible of all the Weakneſs and Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of Man, Sin excepted, and had experienced himſelf what was in the Power of Man to perform?</p>
                  <p>Why, all this does of it ſelf appear to have been conſider'd in the Divine Wiſdom, and in the Contrivance of Man's Recovery to a ſtate of Salvation, through the Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour; but for our better aſſurance, the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> does expreſly declare it to have been ſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17, 18. telling us, That ſince he had undertaken to mediate a Peace for us with God, that <hi>therefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his Brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful High Prieſt, in Things pertaining to God, to make Reconciliation for the Sins of the People: For in that he himſelf hath ſuffered being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi> By being God, he was qualified to be a <hi>faithful High Prieſt in Things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to God, and to make Reconciliation for the Sins of the People:</hi> That is, as God alone, he knew what Satisfaction was ſufficient to be offered to God, and was fit for him to accept, e're he would be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to Sinners; and by being Man, he was alſo qualified <hi>to be a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful High Prieſt; for in that he himſelf hath ſuffered being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted:</hi> That is, as Man, who is ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble what Temptations and Infirmities we lie under, he was more proper to be entruſted with the Appointment of ſuch Terms and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions as Man was capable to perform; and therefore did preſcribe us a Covenant of Grace, conſiſting accordingly of ſuch reaſonable and performable Conditions.</p>
                  <p>And thus you ſee alſo by whoſe Mediation we obtain'd ſuch a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, ſuch a ſtate of Salvation; <hi>viz.</hi> that it was <hi>through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> let us conſider,<note place="margin">The infinite Care of God the Father to call us into it.</note> as you are alſo taught in your Catechiſm, by whom, and how you are called to this ſtate of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And truly, the ſame Heavenly Father who granted us, and the ſame Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour, who purchaſed this ſtate of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for us, have alſo moſt mercifully called us to it.</p>
                  <p>And behold and conſider, firſt, I beſeech you, what infinite Care our Heavenly Father hath taken in this great Affair, to call us to this ſtate of Salvation. <hi>And we have ſeen, and do teſtify,</hi> ſays St. <hi>John, that the Father hath ſent the Son to be the Saviour of the World,</hi> 1 Epiſt. 4.14. And how hath he ſent him to ſave it? Why (as was long before Propheſied, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61.1.) He put the <hi>Spirit of the Lord upon him to preach the Goſpel to the Poor; he ſent him to heal the broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, to preach deliverance to the Captives, and recovering of Sight to the Blind, to ſet at liberty them that are bruiſed, to preach the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Year of the Lord,</hi> Luke 4.18, 19. Such was the very earneſt Care of the Father, that he Commiſſioned, and ſent his own Son to invite us, his Rebellious Creatures and Subjects, to lay down our Rebellious Arms againſt him, and to embrace thoſe Overtures and Conditions of Mercy and Salvation, that he offered to us by the Preaching of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:151517:212"/>
                  <p>Nor was the Ever-bleſſed Son of God leſs intent upon this Bleſſed Work,<note place="margin">The Ever-bleſſed Son of God no leſs intent upon this bleſſed Work.</note> than the Father: No ſure; it was his <hi>Meat to do the Will of Him that ſent him, and to finiſh his Work,</hi> John 4.34. It was his Meat and Drink to ſave Men's Souls; and therefore <hi>He went about doing good,</hi> Acts 10.38. Doing good; that is, Executing that Office to which the Father had Authorized him, in order to the Salvation of Men; that Office of Mercy, inſtructing and calling of the World to Repentance; and, in order to that, winning 'em to it by other Works of bodily Charity, with which carnal Men are moſt taken, as Curing their Diſeaſes, <hi>Caſting out Devils by the Power of him who was preſent with him.</hi> He <hi>went about doing good</hi> of all kinds, but all in order to the good of Men's Souls; and he was zealous alſo, to the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, in this bleſſed Work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">How mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned us to come into this ſtate of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note>For, good God! with what mighty Importunity, and winning Rhetorick, did he, the Son of GOD, addreſs himſelf to his own fooliſh Rebellious Subjects, to come into this ſtate, and to receive freely the <hi>Means of Salvation!

Wherefore do you ſpend Money for that which is not Bread? and your Labour for that which ſatisfieth not? Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your Soul delight it ſelf in fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Encline your Ear, and come unto me; hear, and your Soul ſhall live, and I will make an everlaſting Covenant with you, even the ſure Mercies of David.</hi> It is not to be expreſſed nor imagined, with what mighty Zeal and Perſwaſion he did himſelf, whilſt on Earth, purſue this bleſſed Work of our Salvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">He has left a Succeſſion of Miniſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him to do the like.</note>Nor was he contented himſelf, whilſt on Earth, thus to call us into this <hi>ſtate of Salvation;</hi> but, moreover, when he was to leave the World, he provided a Succeſſion of Miniſters, which he has left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, to continue to the end of the World, to do the ſame good Office under him, for the Salvation of Mankind, empowering them with the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, to enable 'em to do it effectually: <hi>As my Father hath ſent me, ſo ſend I you,</hi> John 20.21.

                  <p>And as <hi>he hath committed to us the Word of Reconciliation, we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Ambaſſadors for Chriſt, and as though God did beſeech you by us, we do pray you in Chriſt's ſtead to be reconciled to God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19, 20.

                  <p>And what, I beſeech you, can be done more? What can be done to call you into a <hi>State of Salvation,</hi> if this will not?

                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed it is a matter that infinitely deſerves the deepeſt Senſe, and utmoſt Acknowledgements of the Divine Goodneſs to us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider barely the Advantages of having GOD in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with us, or our own ſingular Happineſs of being Called into it.</p>
                  <p>And, <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">This great matter of Thankfulneſs whether we conſider, <hi>1.</hi> The extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of having God in Covenant with us.</note> As to the extraordinary Advantage it is to have GOD in Covenant with us (which I have frequent occaſion in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to mind you of) and conſequently that it affords great matter of our Praiſe and Thankſgivings to him upon that account; it is worthy your Notice, that in this caſe, GOD does condeſcend, even to oblige Himſelf by Contract and Agreement with us, whom he might Oblige to Odedience by his mere Authority, without any Aſſurance of Reward, that, if we will but do our part, Repent, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and Obey, he will be even bound in Juſtice, having given his ſolemn Word and Promiſe for it, to confer upon us the richeſt Bleſſings that Heaven and Earth can beſtow, <hi>viz.</hi> Pardon of Sins, and Eternal Life and Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Alas! if we were left to build our Hopes meerly upon the Merit of our own Righteouſneſs and Vertue, we could none of us have the leaſt Expectations of obtaining, as the Reward thereof, ſuch unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Bleſſings as are now laid up in Heaven for us: But GOD con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending by Covenant to engage himſelf to make 'em good to us, we have thereby the fulleſt Aſſurance given us, that we ſhall obtain thoſe Bleſſings; and upon that Aſſurance, the ſtrongeſt Conſolations and Comforts alſo, to chear us in going through the Difficulties we ſhall meet with in performing thoſe Conditions, whereby only we ſhall obtain ſuch unſpeakable Bleſſings.</p>
                  <p>By having GOD in Covenant with us, I ſay, we have the greateſt Aſſurance poſſible, that we ſhall obtain his Favours: To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, thoſe words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> are very remarkable, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.15, 16. <hi>Brethren,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I ſpeak after the manner of Men, tho' it be but a Man's Covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no Man diſannulleth or addeth thereto; now to</hi> Abraham <hi>and his Seed were the Promiſes</hi> (that is, the Covenant) <hi>made:</hi> Which words do import, that if deceitful Man will ſcarcely fail to perform, what he has once obliged himſelf by Covenant to do, it is impoſſible that the God of Truth ſhould fail to make good to the utmoſt, thoſe Bleſſings he has enſured to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed; that is, to all whom he has vouchſafed to enter into Covenant withal.</p>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:151517:213"/>
                  <p>And ſuch Aſſurance given by GOD, does yield alſo the ſtrongeſt Conſolations and Comfort. For why? If you will compare one Scripture with another, you will find, that that which (<hi>Gen.</hi> 17.2.) GOD does call his Covenant, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.13.) is called his Promiſe upon Oath. And what ſays the Apoſtle in that Caſe? Why, GOD, ſays he, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>willing more abundantly to ſhew unto the Heirs of Promiſe, the Immutability of his Counſel, confirmed it by Oath,</hi> or by Covenant, <hi>that by two immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lye, we might have ſtrong Conſolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the Hope ſet before us; which Hope we have, as an Anchor of the Soul, ſure and ſtedfaſt, and which entereth into that within the Veil, whither the FORE-R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NNER is for us entred, even Jeſus.</hi> That is, GOD having aſcertained to us his Bleſſings, by Promiſe upon Oath, or which is tantamount by Covenant, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not upon ſuch Aſſurance but have the greateſt Comfort and Hopes of obtaining thoſe Bleſſings, and ſo of following, e're long, that Jeſus which is gone before us into Heaven, <hi>To prepare a Place for us; that where he is, there we may be alſo,</hi> Joh. 14.2, 3. So that it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable Priviledge, this, of which the World can never be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible, nor thankful to God for, that he vouchſafed to enſure his Mercies to 'em by Covenant. But,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Or, ſecondly, Our ſingular Happineſs therein above the fallen An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, or the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</note>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The occaſion of your Thankfulneſs is yet greater, if you conſider your own ſingular Happineſs, in being called into this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, and in having all God's Mercies thereby ſecured to you, when ſo many Millions of his Creatures do want this Favour. The words of your Catechiſm do teach every one of you to conſider his own particular Intereſt in this Covenant, as the proper matter of his Thankſgiving to God: Every one of you is taught to anſwer for himſelf in particular, <hi>I thank God our Heavenly Father, that he hath called me to this State of Salvation, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi> And indeed, if we are naturally moſt affected with, and moſt ſenſible of thoſe Benefits, which we ſee ſo many beſides our ſelves to want, here is occaſion for the deepeſt Senſe, and utmoſt Acknowledgments of GOD's Goodneſs to you, that you have been called into this <hi>State of Salvation,</hi> when ſo many millions beſides, both Angels and Men, do want the Benefit of it.</p>
                  <p>As to the fallen Angels, the Covenant of Grace was a Favour never afforded by God to them; for Chriſt, that he might <hi>deliver them who all their life-time were ſubject to Bondage, verily took not on him the Nature of Angels, but took upon him the Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15, 16.</p>
                  <p>And as to Men, alas! there are many Nations now in the World, who have not yet enjoyed ſo infinite a Bleſſing, as this happy Call into a <hi>State of Salvation;</hi> who have not yet heard of a Saviour, nor the good Tidings of the Goſpel, or <hi>Covenant of Grace;</hi> who have had no Apoſtles, no Evangeliſts, no Paſtors nor Teachers amongſt 'em, and who therefore ſtill lie groping in Darkneſs, and the ſhadow of Death. And perhaps amongſt thoſe Nations that are called, there are not any that enjoy the Means of Salvation, the Worſhip of GOD, the Adminiſtration of Sacraments, and the Preaching of the Word, in that purity and force, as we in this Church and Nation do. It is
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:151517:213"/> indeed an unſpeakable Bleſſing we enjoy above many other People: <hi>For now in Jeſus Chriſt, we who ſometimes were afar off, are made nigh by the Blood of Chriſt, who is our Peace,</hi> Epheſ. 2.13, 14. <hi>And are no more Strangers and Forreigners, but Fellow-Citizens with the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God,</hi> verſ. 19.</p>
                  <p>It is counted a great Privilege amongſt Men but to enjoy the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of a City, or Corporation, as that which puts thoſe, who enjoy it, above the Condition of Strangers, and gives 'em to partake of many ſingular Advantages which Forreigners want: But by being taken as <hi>Fellow-Citizens of the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God,</hi> into Covenant with him, we are Enfranchized Citizens of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are entituled to all thoſe Privileges which Chriſt has purchaſed for us, which are unſpeakable and invaluable, and which does place us, as has been often ſaid, in ſo much a better State and Condition than the reſt of Mankind. Such infinite reaſon have we <hi>heartily to Thank Almighty God our Heavenly Father, that he hath Called us to this State of Salvation, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Baptiſm, I ſay, is an Outward Rite, or Ceremony, of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's own Appointment, for the ſolemn Admitting of Perſons into the Covenant of Grace.</hi>

                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:151517:214"/>
                  <p>Although the Service preſcribed us in the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> be a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Service, according to that of St. <hi>John,</hi> Chap. 4.23, 24. <hi>But the Hour cometh, and now is, when the true Worſhipers ſhall worſhip the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Spirit and in Truth;</hi> although the Goſpel, I ſay, be a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Service, oppoſite to that Outward and Ritual Service, that was Inſtituted in the Law; in reſpect of which, it was called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.16. <hi>The Law of a carnal Commandment;</hi> yet however it pleaſed Almighty God, to Inſtitute ſome very few Outward Rites and Ceremonies, by which Believers, as by certain Viſible Signs, ſhould be obliged to that Service and Obedience due unto God on their part, and by which even God Himſelf would Seal, as with his Royal Signet, the Favours and Promiſes to be made good on his part; that ſo thoſe Outward So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities might be expreſs Marks of that mutual Agreement betwixt God and Man.</p>
                  <p>And indeed ſince ſuch is the Frame and Conſtitution of Humane Nature, that nothing enters into our Minds,<note place="margin">To have ſome outward Rites and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities in Religion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Frame and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature as being moſt apt to receive Impreſſions from ſenſible Things.</note> but through the Door of our Senſes; and that which does ſtrike our bodily Senſes, does make the deepeſt and moſt laſting Impreſſion upon us; ſince indeed it is ſo with us, it was very agreeable with the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, to have that Reſpect to our Make and Nature in his Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with us, as at the ſame time he threw away the many burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Ceremonies of the Law, to retain ſo many, and ſuch at leaſt, as whereby we might be made more ſenſible of our Engagements to God, and be the better aſſured of his gracious Promiſes unto us. And therefore ſince all Men, in their Covenants one with another, ever uſed ſome Outward and Expreſs Solemnities of Signing and Sealing, for the better Aſſurance of the Performance of Promiſes on both ſides; it was no ways diſagreeable to the Wiſdom of our Saviour in ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing it, nor with the ſpiritual Nature of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> that we ſhould tranſact it with God in ſuch a way and manner, as might make us more deeply ſenſible of our Obligations by it, and more full of Hopes of Benefit and Advantages from it.</p>
                  <p>It was truly well obſerved by the Father,<note place="margin">This eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally requiſite in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into Religious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties and Covenants.</note> 
                     <hi>That Men can be aſſociated together in no Religion, whether true or falſe, unleſs they be combined by the common Tie of ſome ſenſible Signs and Sacraments of their Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> For this reaſon, it is like, that a viſible Sign, or Sacrament might be a continual and apparent Remembrance to 'em, and put 'em in Mind of that Profeſſion they took upon 'em by that Rite; and that it might be a viſible Teſtimony and Witneſs againſt 'em, if they ſhould ever act contrary to that Profeſſion. Hence therefore all the Religions we hear of in the World, have had their ſolemn Rites of <hi>Initiation</hi> or <hi>Admiſſion</hi> into 'em.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itiated both by Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm.</note> they were initiated into the Covenant God made with them, by the Ceremony of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> which is therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a Figure or Form of Speech, very uſual in the mention of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (where the Sign is often put for the Thing ſignified) the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in their Fleſh,</hi> Gen. 17.13. it being the Sign in their Fleſh of their Covenant with God. The <hi>Jews</hi> alſo had their Baptiſms, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they admitted their Proſelytes, or Gentile-Converts, into their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and by Baptiſm they ſay, all their Women who never were Circumciſed, and both Men and Women, during their ſojourning in
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:151517:215"/> the Wilderneſs (when Circumciſion was diſpenſed with, becauſe it would make them ſore for Travelling.) By Baptiſm therefore they were entred into Covenant; and this ſeems alſo to be clear from that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2. <hi>They were all Baptized into</hi> Moſes, or Initiated into the Religion of <hi>Moſes, in the Cloud, and in the Sea.</hi> And indeed the very Heathens likewiſe, they were initiated into their My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries and Worſhip, by ſome ſolemn Rites or other, and that frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Purgations and Waſhings.<note place="margin">The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens were i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiated into their Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations or Waſhings.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now agreeably to both, the Rite, or Ceremony whereby our Saviour appointed that we ſhould be Initiated into the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> or the Chriſtian Religion, was <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> or Waſhing. As our Bleſſed Saviour, out of his infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs, did ordain, That agreeably to our Humane Nature, which is moſt ſenſibly touch'd with Outward Things, the Covenant betwixt him and us ſhould be tranſacted by Outward and Expreſs Solemnities;<note place="margin">Our Saviour choſe the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as what would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to both Parties.</note> ſo he was not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous of having it done by ſuch outward Rites, as were more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known and acceptable both to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> the Rite of Initiation into the <hi>Legal Covenant,</hi> he would not adopt into the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> becauſe it was deteſtable, and had in abomination by the greateſt part of the Heathen World; but <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> or Waſhing, none could except againſt it, either <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> It was uſed by the <hi>Jews,</hi> as well as Circumciſion, to initiate their Proſelytes into Covenant, as was before ſaid; and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did as often uſe it in a Sacramental Manner, when they were entred into any of the Heathen Myſteries of their Pagan Worſhip; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when on any extraordinary Occaſion they profeſſed their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, as appears from <hi>Pilate,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour's ſo ſolemnly Waſhing his Hands, when he would declare himſelf clear of ſhedding the Innocent Blood of the Holy JESUS,<note place="margin">Eſpecially as more ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Purity.</note> 
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.24. And indeed, as on the account of its agreeableneſs to all Parties; ſo chiefly, no doubt, he choſe it for the Sacrament of the Chriſtian Religion, on this laſt ſcore, <hi>viz.</hi> its being ſo ſignificative of the Cleanneſs from the Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sin, of the Purity and Holineſs that all Chriſtians are to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. As Waſhing purges and cleanſes the Body from Dirt and Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſo our Saviour choſe the <hi>Waſhing of Regeneration,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> Tit. 3.5. to be the Rite or Ceremony whereby all his Diſciples ſhould be initiated or entred into his Covenant, or Religion, to ſignify that all his Diſciples muſt be Pure and Holy, not polluted with the Sins and Wickedneſſes of the World.</p>
                  <p>And ſo indiſpenſible a Rite of our <hi>Initiation</hi> or Entrance into the Covenant of Grace<note place="margin">And this he has enjoined, as indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly neceſſary to our initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the Covenant of Grace.</note> did our Saviour make it, that he did not only Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Apoſtles, and all the ſucceeding Miniſters of his Church to the End of the World, to Baptize thoſe whom they did proſelyte over to his Religion, <hi>Go,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>and teach,</hi> or diſciple, by Baptizing 'em, <hi>all Nations, and lo I am with you always to the end of the World:</hi> But he excludes all others from having any Intereſt in his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, which he vouchſafed unto us, and from having any claim to the Promiſes of it, who are not entred into it by the outward Rite and Solemnity, or Ceremony of Baptiſm. Thus he tells <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> with a <hi>Verily, verily;</hi> that is, with a ſolemn Aſſeveration, which amounts almoſt to an Oath, That <hi>Except a Man be born of Water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> By the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:151517:215"/> of God, is here meant the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> which is a Society of Men in Covenant with God, enjoying certain ineſtimable Privileges under Chriſt their Supreme Head; and is often in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment called the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> as <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.31. So that it is plain from hence, that there is no admittance to the Privileges of the Goſpel, or New Covenant, which are Grace, Pardon, and Happineſs; nor to the Enjoyment of thoſe infinite Rewards in Heaven, the chief of all the Mercies of the Covenant, without being firſt entred into the Church by Baptiſm, which is the Outward Seal and Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Mercies to us; <hi>Except a Man be born of Water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And agreeably to this Doctrine of his Lord and Maſter, did the Great St. <hi>Peter</hi> hold Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm ſo indiſpenſibly neceſſary, that he ordered even thoſe Perſons, upon whom at his Preaching of the Word the Holy Ghoſt had fallen (which one would have thought might render Baptiſm unneceſſary) yet he ordered even thoſe to be Baptized withal, as you may ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 10.46, 47, 48. <hi>Then anſwered</hi> Peter, <hi>Can any Man forbid Water, that theſe ſhould not be Baptized, which have received the Holy Ghoſt as well as we? And he commanded them</hi> (Commanded whom? why, thoſe on whom the Holy Ghoſt had fallen, <hi>verſ.</hi> 44. and) <hi>who had received the Holy Ghoſt as well as he,</hi> verſ. 47. he commanded even thoſe <hi>to be Baptized in the Name of the Lord.</hi> Thus is Baptiſm you ſee an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Rite or Ceremony of our Saviour's own Appointment, for the ſolemn admitting of Perſons into the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> And thus our Saviour appointed us to be entered into the Covenant of Grace, <hi>for the better Confirmation and Aſſurance of its Terms, the Promiſes on God's part, and the Conditions on ours; it being thus mutually and interchangeably, as it were, Sealed to betwixt God and us.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Baptiſm ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Rite of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the Covenant of Grace, for the better Confirmation and aſſurance of its Terms, the Promiſes on God's part, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions on ours, it being thus mutually and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably Sealed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and us.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>As in this ſacred Rite of Baptiſm, there are two Parties concerned; God, who by his Miniſter, or <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> and Agent, as he is called, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. does admit the Perſon Baptized to Covenant, and does by him promiſe and engage to confer upon him, particular Bleſſings and Favours; and the Party Baptized, who preſents himſelf, or is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by others; and does ſolemnly engage to <hi>Renounce</hi> GOD's Enemies, <hi>the Fleſh, the World, and the Devil, to Believe in God, and to Obey him:</hi> As there are Two Parties, I ſay, God and Man, thus tranſacting a Covenant together; ſo the Miniſter, God's Agent, his Receiving the Party, and <hi>Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is the Sealing to it on God's Part, who has promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to confirm in Heaven, what they in his Name, and by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, ſhall <hi>bind on Earth,</hi> Matth. 16.19. And the Party preſenting himſelf, or being preſented to Baptiſm, and therein expreſly vowing to perform the fore-mentioned Conditions, and in token of that, his being waſhed or ſprinkled with Water, is the putting to, as it were, his Seal to the Counterpart of the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>And farther, as this mutual Covenanting and Sealing, does give unto God, beſides his <hi>Right of Creation,</hi> a farther Right by our own expreſs Engagements, to our Obedience and Service; ſo to us it gives (even that which we could otherwiſe have, no, not the leaſt Pretenſions
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:151517:216"/> to) even a <hi>Legal Right and Title</hi> to all the moſt ineſtimable Bleſſings and Favours of the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">It gives great Aſſurance of mutual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances barely to be in Covenant together.</note>It has been already more than once hinted, and ſhall here be more fully declared, how that it gives us mighty Aſſurance, that the Mercies of God ſhall certainly be confer'd on us; that he has vouchſafed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage Himſelf in Covenant to make 'em good unto us; and that becauſe this way of proceeding gives us even a <hi>Legal Right and Title</hi> to <hi>All</hi> the moſt ineſtimable Bleſſings and Favours of the Covenant. For this we are to conſider, that till ſuch time as God has condeſcended to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage ſo and ſo, the utmoſt Services that we can pay him, cannot give us ſure and certain grounds to hope for, or expect ſuch invaluable Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to be conferr'd upon us. Though we ſhould never ſo heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent us of our Sins, there is not that in Repentance alone, that it ſhould be ſufficient of it ſelf to ſatisfy the Juſtice of God, and to ſalve that infinite Diſhonour we have done Him by our former Violations of his ſacred Laws: And tho' we ſhould never ſo ſincerely and faithfully Obey him for the future, is it poſſible that ſuch unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Service as ours, ſhould merit and deſerve of it ſelf, the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and unconceivable Joys of Heaven, as a due Reward for ſuch Obedient Service? Pardon of our manifold Sins and Offences, and eternal Joy and Happineſs, I ſay, can never be expected meerly upon any Merit there is in our Repentance and Obedience; nor at all, till ſuch time as he has graciouſly vouchſafed, and freely condeſcended by Covenant, to ſecure ſuch Benefits unto us, upon our ſerious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and ſincere Obedience.</p>
                  <p>But then when he has once condeſcended to enſure unto us by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, theſe unſpeakable Benefits, and we, on the other ſide, have alſo engaged our ſelves to the Performance of ſuch Conditions; then, what our Repentance, Faith and Obedience, could not give us rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect or hope for, meerly upon the account of their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, ſhall however be aſcertain'd to us by virtue of God's Covenant-Obligations, which he has laid upon himſelf: And Pardon and eternal Happineſs ſhall be ſo far then the matter of our Hopes and Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that we ſhall have a <hi>Legal Claim</hi> and Title made over to us, upon our Repentance, Faith, and Obedience to 'em; inſomuch that God will reckon himſelf (as has been before ſaid) in Juſtice and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs bound, both upon the account of Chriſt's Purchaſe, and his own Covenanted Promiſes, to <hi>forgive us our Sins,</hi> as you may ſee, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. and will then own us to have a <hi>Right to the Tree of Life,</hi> Rev. 22.14. We ſhall then, I ſay, have a Right and Title to the Bleſſings of the Covenant, not by virtue of any outward Merit and Deſert in our Performances, but by virtue of the Divine Promiſes and Engagements to thoſe, who having ſolemnly entred into Covenant with him, do take care faithfully to perform the Conditions of it. So that this alone gives us mighty Aſſurance of the Divine Mercies, that we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled thereunto, by his having Covenanted them unto us; as well as he is the more entitled to our Repentance, Faith and Obedience, becauſe we have Covenanted to perform 'em.</p>
                  <p>But yet the more firmly to entitle, as God, to our Obedience; ſo us, to his Mercies; becauſe we never take our ſelves to be ſo well enſured of the performance of Articles, as when we have 'em ſolemnly ſealed to by both Parties; God did therefore, in compliance with our own
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:151517:216"/> Ways and Methods, graciouſly pleaſe to Seal to his part, the Promiſes; and required us to do the like to our part, the Conditions, that he might be the better ſecured of our Covenanted Performances, and we of his promiſed Mercies. And then ſince he has condeſcended to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure unto us, not only by meer Covenant, but moreover to ſeal unto us theſe unſpeakable Benefits; and we, on the other ſide, have alſo ſacramentally ſealed to the Counter-part of the Covenant, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of it; what can there be further thought of to entitle God to our Obedience, or us to his Mercies?</p>
                  <p>And let this ſuffice, as to the Sacrament, or Solemnity, whereby we entred into the Covenant of Grace, which was by Baptiſm. Baptiſm, as you have ſeen, is an Outward Rite or Sacrament of our Saviour's own Appointment, for the ſolemn admitting of Perſons into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, inſtituted by Chriſt for the better Confirmation and Enſurance of its Terms, the Promiſes on God's Part, and the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on ours; it being thus mutually ſeal'd to, betwixt God and us. For, agreeably to our Frame and Nature, as I have told you, which conſiſts of Bodily Senſes, as well as Spiritual Faculties, God has given us, beſides thoſe moſt rational Terms and Conditions of the Covenant Recorded in the Goſpel, being ſuch Promiſes as are becoming the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs of God to make, and ſuch Conditions as are highly befitting us to perform; beſides theſe, he has appointed to us thoſe Outward and Expreſs Solemnities we call the Sacraments, to ſeal theſe Things betwixt us. And becauſe that Baptiſm is a Rite moſt ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative in it ſelf, and would be moſt acceptable to all ſorts of People, Jews and Gentiles, he was therefore pleas'd to <hi>Adopt</hi> that to be the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of our Entrance into, and Sealing the Covenant with him. And this Covenant you have ſeen, he would have thus mutually Sealed to betwixt Him and us, that the Obligations to Performance might be the ſtronger upon us both, to diſcharge each his Part of the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>And thus having ſpoke to the Sacrament, or Solemnity, whereby we enter into Covenant, expreſt in theſe Words, <hi>In my Baptiſm;</hi> the next thing to be ſhewed you is, the great Obligation which lies upon us to Perform this our Covenant with God.</p>

                  <p>IN my Expoſition of the Preliminary Queſtions and Anſwers of your Catechiſm, having already given you a general Account, firſt, of the Nature of the Covenant of Grace; and, ſecondly, of the Sacrament whereby you did ſolemnly enter into it, I ſhall now think my ſelf Happy, if I can but convince you of the mighty Obligations that lie upon you, accordingly to perform it.

                     <hi>As, firſt, if we conſider our ſelves as Members of Chriſt, or Members of the Chriſtian Church, why there cannot be a greater Argument to keep us right in a regular, orderly Converſation, than that one Conſideration ſhould be:</hi> For to be a Member of Chriſt's Church, what elſe, I pray you, is it, but to be one of thoſe Diſciples of our Saviour, who by the Preaching of the Word, and under the Solemnity and Bond of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are Called and Choſen out of the reſt of the World, to live another ſort of Life, than the World is accuſtomed to? To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it would be exceedingly well worth your while, to conſult, and throughly conſider, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11, 12. where you have ſuch
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:151517:217"/> Characters given of the Church of Chriſt, and the Members of it, as ſpeak it to be a ſelected, ſeparated Body of Men, who are <hi>Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> as it were, to God's Service. And ſuch Inferences are drawn from thence, concerning living at an excellent rate upon that very Score, as ſpeak the ſtrongeſt Obligations upon all the Members of Chriſt's Church to approve themſelves therefore, upon that very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, excellent Men. In the 8th. Verſe immediately foregoing, the Apoſtle ſpeaking of thoſe who would not come into the Boſom and Pale of the Church, he terms them a <hi>Diſobedient People;</hi> but coming, in the 9, 10, 11, 12. Verſes, to ſpeak of the <hi>Members of the Church, But ye,</hi> ſays he, <hi>are a Choſen Generation, a Royal Prieſthood, an Holy Nation, a Peculiar People, that ye ſhould ſhew forth the Praiſes of Him, who hath called you out of Darkneſs into his marvellous Light: Which in time paſt were not a People, but are now the People of God; which had not obtained Mercy, but now have obtained Mercy.</hi> 11, 12. Verſes: Therefore, <hi>dearly Beloved, I beſeech you as Strangers and Pilgrims, abſtain from Fleſhly Luſts, which war againſt the Soul, having your Converſation honeſt among the Gentiles; that whereas they ſpeak againſt you as Evil-doers, they may, by your good Works which they ſhall behold, glorifie God in the Day of Viſitation.

They Expreſſions are all of 'em borrowed from the Old Teſtament, and were the Characters then given to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church: And if we will be at the pains to look back into the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law, and ſee what ſeparation and diſtinction they did import there, we ſhall the better diſcern to what elevated degrees of Holineſs, they do ſignify us of the Chriſtian Church to have been likewiſe ſeparated; and conſequently to what a ſingular Life and Converſation we are upon that Score obliged.</p>
                  <p>

                     <note place="margin">Chriſtians choſe both from amongſt Jews and Gentiles, to a more peculiar Holineſs.</note>And now to bring this to our preſent caſe: Does St. <hi>Peter</hi> here, in his Character of the Church of Chriſt, call it a <hi>Choſen Generation, an Holy Nation, a Peculiar People?</hi> Why, what does it import, but that the Members of Chriſt's Church muſt ſtudy to diſtinguiſh themſelves as much now from the Infidel Part of the World, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by Piety and Devotion towards God, Juſtice and Charity towards their Neighbour, and a ſubjecting of their Luſts and Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites to right Reaſon, which is the great Duty to themſelves? I ſay, Chriſtians muſt as much diſtinguiſh themſelves from the profane Crew of Idolatrous and Wicked Heathens, and Unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> by an exact and regular, and a better Life; as the <hi>Jews</hi> were to diſtinguiſh themſelves from the Idolatrous and Wicked Heathens in thoſe days, by a Ritual Holineſs.</p>
                  <p>Nay, And does he call us a <hi>Royal Prieſthood?</hi> Why, this he does here, and alſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. where we are told, That <hi>Chriſt hath made us Kings and Prieſts unto God, and his Father.</hi> And what doth this import, but that we are as much to exceed both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> in holy Living, as the Prieſts among the Jews were to excel the reſt of the People in a <hi>Legal</hi> Purity and Cleanneſs? Chriſtians are to ſhew themſelves to be Kings, by their Victories over the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, over Sin and Satan; and they are to be, as it were, Prieſts, becauſe they are to <hi>preſent their Bodies a living Sacrifice, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, acceptable unto God, which is our reaſonable Service, and are not to be conformed to this World, but to be transformed by the renewing of their Minds,</hi> Rom. 12.1, 2.

                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed ſo much it concerns us, who are <hi>Members of Chriſt's Church,</hi> to diſtinguiſh our ſelves from the reſt of the World by our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Lives, far above other People; that our Bleſſed Saviour came into the World, died, and ſuffered all thoſe ſtupendious Things record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Goſpel, all on this very Deſign, To purchaſe ſuch a Body of Men, that ſhould more peculiarly and zealouſly ſerve God, and to work and perſwade us to it. Thus <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. it is ſaid, That <hi>he gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purify unto himſelf a peculiar People, zealous of good Works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hence were all his Diſcourſes and Preachings to us, (eſpecially that moſt divine Sermon upon the Mount,) to raiſe all his Diſciples and Followers to the higheſt Pitch and Perfection of Moral Vertue and Goodneſs: <hi>He came not to deſtroy the Law and the Prophets, but to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil them,</hi> Matth. 5.27. that is, to enlarge and encreaſe our Duties to God and Man, and to our ſelves; to make the Obedience of the Heart, as neceſſary as that of the outward Man; to make the very Thoughts of Uncleanneſs criminal, as well as Adultery it ſelf. And, in a word, hence does he require of us his Members, that our <hi>Light ſhould ſo ſhine before Men, that they might ſee our good Works, and glorify our Father which is in Heaven,</hi> ver. 16. that is, He requires that by the Eminence of all Divine Graces and Vertues ſhining in our Lives, we ſhould be as a Candle ſet on a Hill, to enlighten the benighted and bewildred World, ſtraying in the darkneſs of Ignorance and Errour, that they might find their way by the Brightneſs of our Examples, to Heaven and Happineſs. And by the Savourlineſs, laſtly, of our good Converſation, he requires that we ſhould be as Salt in the World, to ſeaſon the corrupted Manners of Men. Such ſtrong Obligations lie upon us, as <hi>Members of Chriſt's Church,</hi> to be faithful in our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that is, to perform all due Obedience unto God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Nor is the Conſideration of our being <hi>Children of God,</hi>

There is no relation that is, which does ſpeak more of Duty, and Duty founded upon better Reaſons, than that of a Child to his Father: A Wife owes ſome Duty and Obſervance to her Husband, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>the Husband is the Head of the Wife;</hi> a Servant to his Maſter, becauſe from him he has Proviſion; a Subject to his Prince, becauſe of Protection: But a Child owes his very Life and Being; and all that he has, is originally derived from his Parent.<note place="margin">Children are bound to the ſtricteſt Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Parents, as oweing to 'em their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> Eſpecially this is ſo with the Children of God, upon a double account, both that of <hi>Creation,</hi> and that of <hi>Adoption.</hi> Conſider us as the Children of God with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Creation, and not only our Life and Being, but all Things neceſſary to the ſupport and maintenance of this Being of ours, that it falls not back into Annihilation and Nothing, is wholly owing to that God, <hi>whoſe Off-ſpring we are,</hi> according to that of the Apoſtle,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:151517:219"/>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Children of God, as ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Well-being.</note>And now, if for Life and Being, and alſo for all that Well-being too which we have, or hope to enjoy in this, or the Life to come, we wholly and entirely depend upon God our Father; Do we not then owe to him as his Children, all the Duty, all the Obſervance, and all the Diligence poſſible, in the diſcharge of ſuch Duty and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance? This the very Light of Nature teaches us; but the Scripture does moſt expreſly, upon that very ſcore of being his Children, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of us: <hi>A Son honoureth his Father, and a Servant his Maſter,</hi> ſays God by his Prophet, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6. <hi>If I then be a Father, where is mine Honour? And if I be a Maſter, where is my Fear?</hi> And upon the ſame ſcore of our being Children of God, does St. <hi>Peter</hi> moſt earneſtly exhort us to a Renunciation of the World, and our filthy Luſts, and to a faithful and careful diſcharge of our Duty to God our Father: <hi>As Obedient Children,</hi> ſays he, 1 Epiſt. 1.14, 15. <hi>not faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelves according to the former Luſts in your Ignorance; but as he which hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</hi> And verſ. 17. <hi>If ye call on the Father,</hi> (that is, profeſs your ſelves the Sons of your Heavenly Father) <hi>who without reſpect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, judgeth every Man according to his Works,</hi> can ſee Blemiſhes, and will puniſh Faults, as well in his Children as others; if you profeſs your ſelves the Children of ſuch a Father, <hi>paſs the time of your ſojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here in fear,</hi> is the Inference the ſame Apoſtle makes from this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, of being the Children of God.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, except we do give up our ſelves ſincerely and faithfully to obey God, and in all Points to diſcharge our Covenant with him, we are in effect not the <hi>Children of God,</hi> however Baptized, and ſo in Profeſſion, but in reality are the Children of the Devil, and from him muſt expect our Reward: So St. <hi>John</hi> aſſures us, 1 Epiſt. 3.8, 9. <hi>He that committeth Sin, is of the Devil;</hi> that is, he that committeth any act of known Sin, is in that, ſo far from being a <hi>Child of God,</hi> that he is a Child of the Devil, of whom, and not of God, he is an Imitator; <hi>For whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit Sin; for his Seed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in him, and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God:</hi> That is, as the Learned <hi>Hammond</hi> does Paraphraſe upon the ſame place, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is a true Child of God, keeps himſelf ſtrictly from every delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Act of Sin; and the reaſon is, Becauſe that contrary Principle of Regeneration, or Son-ſhip (from which he is ſaid to be born of God) if that continue to have any Life or Energy in it, is utterly contrary and incompatible with Sin. And then does follow that Characteriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal diſtinguiſhing Mark he does give of a Child of God, and a Child of the Devil, ſhewing the grand difference between one and the other. <hi>In this the Children of God are manifeſted, and the Children of the Devil, whoſoever doth not Righteouſneſs, is not of God,</hi> ver. 10.</p>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:151517:219"/>
                  <p>In a word, to conclude this Argument alſo: As it is almoſt natural, and therefore ever expected, that Children ſhould imitate the Life and Manners of their Parents; and if they prove diſſolute, and of looſe Behaviour, it does uſually redound to the Parents diſgrace, as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſuppoſed to proceed from ſlackneſs of Government; ſo, ſhould we, who are Children of God, be <hi>Covenant-Breakers,</hi> prove lawleſs and diſſolute Livers, it will extreamly tend to the Diſhonour of our Heavenly Father, whoſe Name is then <hi>hallowed</hi> amongſt Men, when we his profeſt Sons and Servants, do dutifully and ſincerely fulfil our Engagements to Him; but, on the contrary, is then blaſphemed, when we live ungodly Lives. So that this grand Favour and Privilege of being the Sons of God, is another moſt powerful Argument to render us faithful in our Covenant with Him. And ſo likewiſe it is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To be an <hi>Inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>III.</hi> As Inheritors of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint will it put upon a young Heir, and how careful will it make him to pleaſe his Parents, when a great Eſtate is like to deſcend upon him; but yet ſo, that he ſhall certainly be diſ-inherited of it, except he behave himſelf ſoberly, and regularly, and dutifully to thoſe his Parents? And if ſo, how infinitely more circumſpect, and wary, and diligent ſhould we all of us be, to pleaſe <hi>our Father which is in Heaven,</hi> by diſcharging our Covenant-Engagements to him, inaſmuch as the Heavenly Inheritance is of infinite more value than an Earthly one can be.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not ſtand now to give you a Deſcription of that <hi>Exceeding Weight of Glory,</hi> and of thoſe Vaſt and Immenſe Treaſures of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which are laid up in Heaven for thoſe who ſhall faithfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Covenant with God; I ſhall only in ſhort ſhew you, that ſuch is the Nature and Conſtitution of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> that there is no Hopes nor Expectations of ever obtaining it, without a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſcharge of all our Covenant-Engagements to God; and if ſo, then certainly there cannot be greater Obligations poſſible to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of 'em. And as to the Nature of the Covenant of Grace, ſurely one would think it were needleſs to prove, that the Conditions of it muſt be performed, or we cannot expect to inherit the Promiſes. This is of the Nature of all Covenants whatſoever, which conſiſt of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Promiſes and Benefits to be made good on one part, not without certain Conditions to be performed on the other.<note place="margin">Kingdom of Heaven not to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but by thoſe who are faithful in their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> And why then ſhould any ſo fondly expect <hi>Juſtification</hi> and Happineſs to be conferr'd upon 'em, except they do <hi>Repent heartily, Believe practically,</hi> and <hi>Obey ſincerely,</hi> the only Conditions of this Covenant, as has been often ſhewed? Why, ſure none that look into the Goſpel, and ſee and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how that all along Happineſs is only promiſed to the Obedient, can ever expect it upon other Terms. But ſo it is, that a ſort of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian</hi> Hereticks do ſpread abroad their peſtilent Doctrines, teaching that Chriſt by his Sacrifice and Satisfaction for us, has purchaſed Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Happineſs, without any Conditions to be perform'd on our part; and, that what he has done will wholly excuſe us from Duty and Obedience. But this is one of the moſt Anti-chriſtian Errors in the World, as undermining the whole deſign of Chriſt's Coming, and his Preaching the Goſpel amongſt us; which was to tie us up to higher Rules of Righteouſneſs, than were before given to the Sons of
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:151517:220"/> Men. It was infinitely far from the Deſign of him, who came to ſave and deliver us from the Power and Dominion, as well as from the Guilt and Puniſhment of our Sins, to do any thing that ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us in Sin, and render us ſecure when at any time we commit it. But that which Chriſt has done for us, amounts to this, that he has purchaſed, by his Blood-ſhedding, an Abrogation of the Firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, wherein was no Happineſs without an unſinning Obedience; and then has procured for us this moſt gracious Covenant, with theſe abatements of Rigour, That we ſhall have all that unſpeakable Bliſs, and the <hi>Inheritance of Heaven</hi> conferr'd on us, on condition we ſhall repent of, and forſake our Sins, and knowingly and willingly not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him for the future.</p>
                  <p>And a moſt encouraging Argument this will be to all conſidering and ſerious Perſons, to make 'em faithful and diligent to perform their Covenant. No People, either <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ever before us had the like. The <hi>Jews,</hi> by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the meer Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, had plainly and expreſly the Aſſurances only of a Temporal <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Promiſes of a peaceable and proſperous Poſſeſſion thereof, to encourage their Duty. And the poor Pagans had little Inducements to vertuous living, more than the preſent Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of Mind, which ariſes from the meer Exerciſe of Vertue; neither of 'em Conſiderations ſtrong enough to bear us up againſt great Temptations to Sin, and the difficulties in the way of our Duty. But this one Conſideration of an <hi>Eternal weight of Glory,</hi> an Inheritance laid up in Heaven, a <hi>Crown of Life,</hi> infallibly enſured to thoſe who ſhall <hi>be faithful unto Death:</hi> This is enough to encourage us in Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, and to preſerve us ſafe and innocent (as it has done Thouſands before us) amidſt all the Perſecutions of Evil Men on the one hand, or the Allurements of the World on the other, withdrawing us, or frighting us into Sin; ſo that in the ſtrength of the Hopes of ſuch an Inheritance, we may be prevail'd upon, faithfully and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly to diſcharge this our Covenant with God.</p>
                  <p>And thus you ſee what mighty Arguments the ſeveral Mercies of the Covenant made over to us on God's Part, do yield us; and what inviolable Obligations they do all of 'em lay upon us, faithfully and conſcientiouſly to diſcharge this our Covenant with God. But,</p>

                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>IV.</hi> As having promiſed and vowed in our Baptiſm ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, to diſcharge our Covenant w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> God.</note>
                     <hi>Fourthly</hi> and laſtly, Another vaſt Obligation lying upon us to do the ſame, and which ought eſpecially to be here conſidered, is, <hi>That Promiſe and Vow made for us in our Baptiſm, accordingly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge this our Covenant. Do'ſt thou not think, that thou art bound to Believe and to Do as they have promiſed for thee?</hi> That is the Queſtion which is ask'd you; to which you are taught to anſwer, <hi>Yes, verily;</hi> and thereby to acknowledge the vaſt Obligations lying upon you, on the account of that Promiſe and Vow, to perform that your Covenant; and a mighty Obligation too it lies upon us, there being nothing more ſacred and inviolable than a <hi>Vow</hi> made unto God, and more ſeverely puniſht, if it be ever violated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The matter of a Vow ſometimes not a Duty 'till vowed.</note>
                     <hi>A Vow in general is defin'd to be a ſolemn Promiſe made unto God, whereby we do in a peculiar manner engage our ſelves unto him to the performance of ſomething.</hi> And there are two ſorts of theſe Vows, which are to be diſtinguiſh'd according to the Matter of which the Vow is made: For ſometimes the Thing which we have vowed to do,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:151517:220"/> was not a Duty upon us, till ſuch time as we made ſuch a Vow; as when a Perſon does ſolemnly promiſe to God, that he will ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part ſuch a Portion of his Time, ſuch a Day of the Week, for the more immediate Service of God, in Faſting and Prayer; or that he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote ſuch a part of his Eſtate or Gains for pious or charitable Uſes. Secondly, again, the matter of a Vow<note place="margin">Sometimes antecedently incumbent upon us, and ſuch is the matter of our Baptiſmal Vow.</note> may be what was incumbent upon us before, only the Vow is added to ſtrengthen the Obligation: And ſuch is the Vow was made in our Baptiſm, whereby we were ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly and in a peculiar manner Devoted and Conſecrated to God's Service, and to live to his Glory; which though it was a Duty upon us before, yet now we have farther obliged our ſelves thereunto, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſolemnly vowed ſo to do. Generally the matter of a Vow is of the former ſort, ſomething to which we were not obliged before; as when <hi>Jacob</hi> did vow to <hi>build an Houſe to God,</hi> Gen. 28.22. And of this nature are all thoſe Lands and Poſſeſſions, over and above the Tythe, or Tenth Part, which have been devoted and given by the Piety of well-diſpos'd Perſons, for the Maintenance of the Miniſters, and the Worſhip of God, for the Education of Children in Schools, and the Relief of the Poor in Hoſpitals. Before they were devoted to pious and charitable Uſes, they were ſo far in the Power of the Party who own'd 'em, as that he might diſpoſe of 'em how, and to what Uſes he pleaſed. But after a Vow is once made by our ſelves, or Forefathers, whereby ſuch a Part of an Eſtate is determinately ſet aſide for ſacred Uſes, it is then <hi>a devoted thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I will be bold to add (and I will endeavour to prove it) that for that very reaſon of its having been Vowed and Devoted to God,<note place="margin">'Tis a provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Sin to rob God of what has been once Vowed and Devoted to him, tho' of the former Nature.</note> it is one of the moſt provoking Sins in the World to <hi>rob God</hi> of it. This is plainly ſeen, in the Caſe of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> Act. 5.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Theſe two Perſons, ſtirr'd up at firſt, as is probable, with a like pious Zeal for the Promotion of Religion, with many others of the firſt Converts to Chriſtianity, had ſold a Poſſeſſion, and given it to the Church (which according to the Circumſtances of thoſe Times, was of more uſe than if ſetled upon it) but Covetouſneſs afterwards pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing upon their Hearts, they <hi>kept back part of the Price,</hi> and laid a ſhare of it only <hi>at the Apoſtles feet,</hi> v. 3. But obſerve how ſeverely <hi>Peter</hi> rebukes 'em for this Sacrilege: Before they had devoted it, he tells 'em they might have done what they would with it; but firſt to beſtow it wholly on the Church, and then <hi>to keep back part of the Price</hi> of the Land, he calls this <hi>a Lying to the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately (for the terrour of other ſacrilegious Invaders of Things devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) puniſhes it with one of the moſt ſudden and fearful Deaths that we find recorded, either in the Scripture, or profane Story. This Sin of with-holding or ſeizing of any thing once Vowed and Devoted by our ſelves or others to ſacred Uſes, is called the Sin of Sacrilege, and is ſpoke of, as ſeems by the manner of Expreſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.22. as a Sin equalling the Guilt even of Idolatry it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And nothing is more plain to be obſerv'd, than the Anger of God,<note place="margin">God's Anger obſervable up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</note> even in this Life, towards thoſe who have ſacrilegiouſly invaded God's Portion, which has been once Vowed unto him, either by our ſelves, or our Forefathers, and have <hi>Robbed him in his Tythes and Offerings,</hi> as he calls it a robbing of Himſelf, <hi>Mal.</hi> 7.8. and threatens it with a heavy Curſe, of the Execution whereof, if I had time, I could give
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:151517:221"/> ſeveral inſtances. But let this ſuffice to ſhew how heinous a thing it is to violate a Vow to God, even where the matter of the Vow hath been ſomething to which there was no Obligation before ſuch Vow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">'Tis much more provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Vows; to perform w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we are ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note>And will it be leſs provoking then, think ye, to violate thoſe Vows, wherein by ſolemn Engagements, Men have promiſed to do that which before ſuch Vows and Promiſes they were obliged to from the Law of Nature, and as a Debt due for their very Creation and Being? In this caſe, there is a double Obligation to perform ſuch Vows: When that which was commanded to be done, and is neceſſary upon other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, is with all ſolemnity engaged to be performed, then the Vow does add to the Command, a new and farther Obligation, which will make it more criminal, and a far more heinous Sin to break ſuch Vows. There are many of this kind recorded in the Scripture, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the firſt part of that Vow of <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 28.21. is of this kind; and ſo is our <hi>Baptiſmal Vow</hi> to perform the Covenant of Grace: We were obliged to perform all that Duty, which we therein engaged to perform, by the very Law of Nature, upon the account of our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and dependance upon God, from whom, as a Fountain, we derive all the Good we already have, and hope to enjoy. But when, moreover, we come ſolemnly and expreſly to engage our ſelves to the performance of ſuch Conditions, we add ſtrength to our former Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, tying 'em faſter upon our ſelves; and in the breach of the Laws of God, we thenceforward become not only barely diſobedient, but moreover faithleſs and <hi>Covenant-breakers,</hi> and ſhall be therefore puniſh'd, not only as diſobedient, but alſo as faithleſs and perfidious Rebels.</p>
                  <p>Nor does it in the leaſt leſſen the Obligation, that this Vow was made by others for you in your Infancy; for not to prove to you now, which ſhall be done in its due place, that it is in the Power of Parents or Guardians, to oblige their Minors to the Performance of Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, without their own expreſs Conſent at that time, provided there ſhall conſiderable Advantages accrue to 'em thereby; it is moreover plain from Scripture, that Parents may devote their Children to the Service of God in a very peculiar manner; and therefore they had Power to devote us to the Worſhip of the True God, as preſcribed us in the Goſpel, or New Covenant; to which Covenant we ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtand obliged, as much as if in our Perſons we had Vowed and Engaged our ſelves to perform it. Of this Power in Parents we ſee an inſtance in <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.11. Nor is the thing contrary to Reaſon, and natural Equity, the Philoſopher himſelf affirming, that both the Parents may devote the Children whilſt young, as they pleaſe, ſince Children at that Age are to be accounted not ſo much at their own, as at their Parents diſpoſal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A Vow is much of the nature of an Oath, and therefore to violate it is Perjury.</note>The thing is juſt and reaſonable, and therefore it is highly criminal in us to break that Baptiſmal Vow. It is a Sin much of the nature of Perjury, a Vow and an Oath being promiſcuouſly uſed in Scripture, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 30.13. one for another. And indeed as to our Baptiſmal Vow, ſince therein God is made a Witneſs, a Judge, and a Revenger, it is in its full importance no leſs than an Oath, and the violating thereof would be Perjury. He is called to, as a Witneſs of our Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, in what we do promiſe, and oblige our ſelves thereby to do: He is appeal'd to, as a Judge of our Performance, whether we are faithful
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:151517:221"/> or not. And as he is a God that will not be mocked, he will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be a Revenger, and a ſevere one too, if we ſhall falſly and perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly break our Vows of <hi>Renouncing the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, of Believing in God, and Obeying him;</hi> and ſhall, on the contrary, give our ſelves up to the ſervice of Sin and Satan, live like thoſe that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not God, nor the Chriſtian Religion, and in perfect contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the Apoſtle's Rule, <hi>deny</hi> not <hi>all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and Worldly Luſts,</hi> as we are commanded, and have promiſed; but deny to <hi>live Soberly, Righteouſly, and Godly in this preſent World.</hi> In ſuch a caſe, I ſay, he will be a ſevere Revenger of our Perjury, and of our <hi>Apoſtacy;</hi> I ſay of our <hi>Apoſtacy;</hi> for he will then conſider us not as ordinary Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but as thoſe who have in effect renounced our Religion, and will allot to us therefore not the ordinary meaſures of Puniſhments due to unbelieving <hi>Jews, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Infidels;</hi> but extraordinary ones, ſuch as are due to faithleſs and perfidious <hi>Renegado's.</hi> Oh, it had been happy for us, if we had never been Baptized; if after thoſe Vows we have therein made, to do all we can to deſtroy <hi>Satan's Kingdom,</hi> and the Power of Sin in the World, we ſhall fight againſt God by our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and wicked Deeds, <hi>Better it is that thou ſhouldſt not Vow, than that thou ſhouldſt Vow, and not pay,</hi> Eccl. 5.5. It is a leſs fault not to Vow at all, than having Vowed, not to perform; the one being but a Neglect, the other an Affront, nay, a Contempt of his Majeſty, who will not ſuffer a ſcorn to be put upon himſelf.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall I ſay? why take therefore the Advice of the Wiſe Man, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>When thou voweſt a Vow unto God, deferr not to pay it: for he hath no pleaſure in Fools; pay that which thou haſt Vowed:</hi> And ſay reſolutely with Holy <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.106. <hi>I have ſworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous Judgments;</hi> I have ſolemnly reſolved, and bound my ſelf by the moſt ſacred Ties, which I will never break, but do now confirm; that I will carefully <hi>perform my part of the Covenant,</hi> which I find to be moſt juſt and good.</p>

                     <hi>THE XXVII Lecture.</hi> And by God's Help ſo I will. And I pray unto God to give me his Grace that I may continue in the ſame unto my Live's End.</head>
                  <p>IN thoſe ſeveral Expoſitions I have made upon the Words of your Catechiſm, I have now fully declar'd unto you, firſt, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Nature, Terms, and Conditions of the Covenant of Grace; ſecondly, the Sacrament whereby you ſolemnly enter'd into it. And laſt Day have repreſented to you thoſe vaſt Obligations lying upon you faithfully, and conſcientiouſly to diſcharge the ſame. And I know nothing ſo fit next to be ſpoke of, as the Means whereby we ſhall be enabl'd to perform this our Covenant; and what they are, theſe Words I have now read do declare unto you. <hi>And by God's,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In which you are given to to underſtand,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. That in order to perform the Covenant with God, you muſt put on a fix'd and firm Reſolution faithfully to diſcharge the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. But a Reſolution it muſt be, took up, not in Confidence of our own Strength, but of God's Grace and Aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. And accompany'd therefore with moſt earneſt Prayers to God not to let us to our ſelves, but to be always preſent with us. <hi>So I will:</hi> Theſe Words import the firm Reſolution. <hi>By God's Help ſo I will:</hi> Theſe ſhew it muſt be a Reſolution made not in Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our own Strength. <hi>And I pray unto God to give me his Grace, that I may continue in the ſame unto my Live's End:</hi> Theſe expreſs how neceſſary Prayer will be to obtain that Aſſiſtance, which alone can fortifie our Reſolutions. I ſhall inlarge here only on the former; namely, Firſt, <hi>That to put on a fix'd and firm Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion faithfully to diſcharge your Covenant with God, will be a great Means towards your Performance of it.</hi> In order to make which appear,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="294" facs="tcp:151517:223"/>1. I will briefly reflect upon the Nature of your Baptiſmal Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I will ſhew you what kind of Reſolution you ought to put on to perform the ſame. And,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I will then manifeſt to you how much ſuch a Holy Reſolution will conduce to your Performance of it.</p>
                  <p>And, <hi>Firſt,</hi> let us briefly reflect upon the Nature of our Baptiſmal Covenant: And the Summ of what has been ſaid upon the Doctrine of your <hi>Baptiſmal Covenant</hi> is briefly this; namely, that in your Baptiſm you were Incorporated into that Holy Society of Men, which is call'd the Church of Chriſt, and were made your ſelves <hi>Members</hi> of it. You were <hi>Adopted</hi> to be his <hi>Children,</hi> and ſuch as he would have a peculiar Care of, and would indulge with ſingular Favours. And as the Perfection of all, you had then an <hi>Inheritance</hi> of the Kingdom of Heaven inſur'd to you, ſo as to have a legal Right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd upon you to all thoſe unſpeakable Joys contain'd in that State. All theſe peculiar Favours you had then conferr'd upon you on God's part, on theſe Terms and Conditions, to be made good on yours; namely,</p>
                  <p>That you would firſt utterly <hi>Renounce</hi> thoſe great Enemies of God, the <hi>Devil,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Fleſh.</hi> The Devil, becauſe he had Rebell'd againſt his Creator, for which he was Baniſh'd Heaven, and has been ever ſince endeavouring to withdraw Mankind to partake, and ſide with him in the ſame wicked Revolt: But you have Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted with God that you will utterly abhor ſo baſe a thing, as to ſide with ſo curſed a Spirit, either by your own Sins, or by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting of others to ſin: And that you will be always upon your Guard againſt all his curſed Wiles, whereby he would withdraw you into ſo foul an Apoſtacy from God. As to the <hi>World,</hi> becauſe the greateſt Part of Mankind have been prevail'd upon by this wicked Spirit to deſert their Creator, you have Covenanted to <hi>Renounce</hi> their Ways, ſo as not to be tempted by their Examples, their Company, their Perſuaſions, their Threats, or their Promiſes, to deſert alſo the great Captain of your Salvation Jeſus Chriſt. And as to the Material World, that neither the Riches, the Honours, nor the Pleaſures of it ſhould allure you, nor the evil and vexatious things of it ſhould fright you into Sin. And laſtly, as to theſe Enemies of God and us, you did ſolemnly engage your ſelves to exerciſe a continual Warfare againſt the <hi>Corrupt Luſts</hi> of your ſinful Nature, which are ever and anon Rebelling againſt the Dictates of your own Reaſon, and of the Holy Spirit of God. Thus in your Baptiſm you did Covenant to <hi>Renounce the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And you did on the contrary then engage, as you have ſeen, that you would give a hearty and ready Aſſent to all thoſe Divine Truths reveal'd to you in the Scripture, and given to conduct you to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; particularly, and eſpecially that you would give an entire Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to thoſe Great and <hi>Fundamental Articles of Chriſtian Faith</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in your <hi>Creed;</hi> and that you would ſo throughly <hi>Believe</hi> 'em, as to be influenc'd by 'em to the performance of the</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Third</hi> thing you engag'd in your Baptiſm; and that was, that you
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:151517:223"/> would <hi>ſincerely</hi> and <hi>entirely obey God's Holy Will and Commandments, and walk in the ſame all the days of your Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was that Covenant we made with God in our Baptiſm. It was obtain'd for us when we were under Condemnation for the breach of our firſt Covenant, whereby we had rebell'd againſt God, and took part with the Devil. For being in this miſerable Condition, then did the Eternal Son of God ſacrifice his own Life to make Satisfaction to the Divine Juſtice for our Sins; and did moreover Mediate with his Father for us, that we might be receiv'd into favour upon the Terms now mention'd. And he did not only come down from Heaven him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to <hi>call us into this State of Salvation,</hi> but ſent alſo his Prophets, Apoſtles, and Miniſters, as his Embaſſadors, in all Ages, to invite Mankind into it, and <hi>to pray 'em in Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>ſtead to be reconciled to God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.20.</p>
                  <p>And ſo many of the World as have hearken'd to that <hi>Call,</hi> have been admitted by Baptiſm to thoſe Terms of Reconciliation; and have in that Solemn Ordinance dedicated themſelves to the Service of God, and have vowed to perform it, as has been now declared. To be faithful to which Vow you have all poſſible Obligations lying upon you; and, particularly, becauſe you have ſo ſolemnly at your Baptiſm, ſworn to perform it. And in order to that, ſince <hi>Chriſtian Reſolution,</hi> eſpecially if publickly and ſolemnly made, will have a great force in it to preſerve you from the Power of Temptation, you muſt therefore <hi>ſtedfaſtly reſolve</hi> to continue faithful in your Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; only this you muſt take care of, not to reſolve <hi>ſo to do,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of your own Strength, but of God's Grace and Aſſiſtance, which you muſt therefore earneſtly <hi>pray to him for.</hi> And that you may the better know how to form ſuch Reſolution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I am next to ſhew you <hi>the Nature of that Reſolution, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in theſe Words, <hi>So I will,</hi>
                     </hi> and which will ſo very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the performance of your Covenant. And <hi>by Chriſtian Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution is meant a peremptory, but rational Determination of the Will to a vigorous and ſpeedy Execution of thoſe Vows and Promiſes made in Baptiſm, notwithstanding all Temptations, to the contrary; and this publickly, delaratively, and ſolemnly made.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Reſolution is a Determination of the Will.</hi> Before the Mind comes to a Reſolution, there is uſually ſome Doubtfulneſs and Heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation what Courſe to take; but when a Perſon once puts on a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, there is no longer <hi>halting between God and Baal,</hi> the Fault of the unreſolved Jews, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.21. The Man is determined within himſelf to adhere to God. And this his Determination muſt be,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Fix'd and peremptory,</hi> oppoſite to <hi>Fickleneſs and Inconſtancy.</hi> This was the Temper of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the moſt irreſolute People in the World, who were continually changing their Gods, and their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for which the Prophet upbraids 'em. <hi>Hath a Nation changed their Gods, which yet are no Gods? But my People have changed their Glory for that which doth not profit,</hi> Jer. 2.11. And a perpetual round of ſinning and repenting, and of repenting and ſinning again, does ſadly betray the irreſolute Diſpoſition of too many Chriſtians amongſt us. But,</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="296" facs="tcp:151517:224"/>3. Chriſtian Reſolution is a <hi>Rational Determination of the Will;</hi> that is, It is not a <hi>Wilfulneſs,</hi> a <hi>Stubbornneſs,</hi> and an <hi>Obſtinacy;</hi> ſuch as makes Men without Reaſon; nay, and contrary to Reaſon, to ſtick unmoveable from an Opinion, or to a courſe of Life they have taken up in deſpite of all Evidence and Reaſon to the contrary: A Temper very far from being Chriſtian, but proceeding from wilful Ignorance and Pride, or a ſourneſs and fullenneſs of Nature. Such was that perverſe Temper of the <hi>Jews,</hi> of whom <hi>Jeremiah</hi> complains, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.12. as being reſolute without reaſon, ſaying, <hi>We will walk after our own Devices, and we will every one do the Imagination of his Heart.</hi> But a Man of Reſolution weighs every thing firſt before he fixes. And the true Method of forming a true Chriſtian Reſolution is this, The Perſon who does it, as our Saviour repreſents his Proceeding, ſits down and conſiders on the one hand, the very great Difficulties and Temptations there are in the Chriſtian Warfare againſt the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>Devil;</hi> and moreover, that it is <hi>better not to Vow, than to Vow and not Pay,</hi> Eccl. 5.4. Nay, and he conſiders his own extream Weakneſs, ſo as not to be able of himſelf to Encounter three ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Enemies as the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil. But then on the other ſide he conſiders the Glorious Rewards of thoſe who come off Conquerors, that if he does not Liſt himſelf in God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, by entring into, and often Renewing his Covenant with God, he will be a Bond-ſlave to the Devil, and eternally and unavoidably undone; and that <hi>tho' of himſelf he is able to do nothing, yet through Chriſt that ſtrenghthens him he can do all things,</hi> Phil. 4.13. And as the Reſult of this Conſideration, he does moſt rationally and wiſely form a fixt and peremptory Reſolution to <hi>Fight the good Fight of Faith,</hi> and Maugre all Temptations, and Hazards, or Loſſes, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a faithful Soldier and Servant of his Saviour Chriſt. And this, I ſay, is the Importance of that Parable of our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.31, 32, 33. where, under the Character of a King going to War againſt a powerful Enemy, conſidering his Danger, and providing accordingly againſt it, he repreſents how we Chriſtians muſt form our Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And when the Will is thus <hi>Rationally determin'd</hi> what courſe to take, then the Reſolute Diſciple of Chriſt determines to proceed to a <hi>Vigorous Execution of his Vows and Promiſes.</hi> This is a part of Reſolution oppoſite to <hi>Weakneſs</hi> and <hi>Faintneſs</hi> of Purpoſe, as when Perſons Wiſh, aad would be glad to do ſo and ſo. <hi>O that I could die the Death of the Righteous,</hi> ſaid <hi>Bulaam, Numb.</hi> 23.10. And alſo Oppoſite it is to that <hi>Eaſineſs of Diſpoſition,</hi> a Diſtemper of Mind which is very falſly, but commonly call'd Good Nature, which makes Perſons ready to yield, notwithſtanding their former good Purpoſes, to the Importunities, Perſwaſions, or Allurements of the next Tempter. Thus one of thoſe eaſie Perſons is repreſented, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.7. as one whom the Harlot <hi>meeting, with her much fair Speech cauſed him to yield; ſo that he went after her ſtraitway, as an Ox goeth to the Slaughter, or as a Fool to the Correction of the Stocks,</hi> ver. 22.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And the Reſolute Chriſtian, as he determines vigorouſly, ſo alſo <hi>ſpeedily</hi> to put in execution what he has, upon mature Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration deſign'd. He does not think of putting off his Repentance
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:151517:224"/> till another Day. Nor of deferring the hearing of good Advices till another time, like <hi>Foelix,</hi> who when St. <hi>Paul reaſon'd</hi> to him <hi>of Righteouſneſs, Temperance, and Judgment to come, did ſhift off the Apoſtle with a go thy way for this time, when it is a more convenient Seaſon I will call for thee,</hi> Acts 24.25. On the contrary, the truly reſolute Chriſtian takes <hi>David</hi> for his Pattern, who having <hi>thought upon his Ways, turn'd his Feet unto God's Teſtimonies. And made haſte and delay'd not to keep his Commandments,</hi> Pſal. 119.59, 60.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And he determines vigorouſly and ſpeedily to betake himſelf to the Execution of <hi>all thoſe Vows and Promiſes made in his Baptiſm.</hi> The Reſolute Chriſtian makes no Exceptions of ſome particular Luſts, ſome darling Sins; but if there be any one more than ordinary dear to him, he determines immediately to Mortifie, to <hi>Cut off that,</hi> tho' as near as his <hi>right Arm,</hi> and <hi>to pluck it out,</hi> tho' as tender as his <hi>right Eye.</hi> He is not like King <hi>Agrippa</hi> whom St. <hi>Paul almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to be a Chriſtian,</hi> but he is <hi>both Almoſt and Altogether</hi> like St. <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 26.28, 29. who held no Correſpondence and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with any of the Enemies of God and his own Soul; but is reſolv'd to abandon them all alike, to Believe every Article, and to Obey every Command.</p>
                  <p>And thus the Reſolv'd Chriſtian determines to go on uniformly in the diſcharge of all his Engagements, <hi>notwithſtanding all Oppoſitions from the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil.</hi> What mighty Difficulties they will raiſe him, how many Blocks they will put in his Way, and what cunning Stratagems the Devil particularly will make uſe of to divert him from his Good Purpoſes, and to make him break his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, you have already ſhew'd you. But the Man of Reſolution is a Man of Courage, and will not through Fearfulneſs and Cowardice give way in the Day of Battle. But with St. <hi>Paul</hi> is <hi>perſwaded,</hi> becauſe he is Reſolved, <hi>That neither Death, nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor Things preſent, nor Things to come, nor Heighth, nor Depth, nor any other Creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate him from the Love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord,</hi> Rom. 8.38, 39.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> And now to render the Chriſtian Reſolution compleat in all its Parts, you muſt <hi>publickly, declaratively,</hi> and <hi>ſolemnly proteſt it to all the World,</hi> that it is the full determination of your Heart and Mind to adhere faithfully to God againſt all his Enemies, the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, that you will neither ſwerve from your Faith, nor flinch from your Obedience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Publick</hi> and <hi>Declarative</hi> this Reſolution muſt be upon all Juſt Occaſions, as when Prophaneſs and Impiety grow bold and daring; and when Sinners become Impudent and Triumphant in Immodeſt and Immoral Courſes. And when the Profeſſion of Religion is thrown off as Ridiculous, and below Men of Senſe and Spirit. In ſuch an Age as this, I ſay, there is occaſion given to all the faithful Servants of Chriſt, to own and declare themſelves his Diſciples, and that they are not aſham'd of him and his Doctrines. And with the Noble <hi>Mattathias,</hi> 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 2.19. they muſt be ready to ſay, <hi>Tho' all the Nations under the Kings Dominions ſhall fall, every one from the Religion of their Fathers, yet will I, and my Sons, and my Brethren, walk in the Covenant of our Fathers.</hi> A Noble and Heroick Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:151517:225"/> worthy of us Chriſtians to follow, and abſolutely neceſſary to be put on at this time, when the Publick Affronts to God and his Religion are greater than were ever in a State profeſſing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
                  <p>And as the Reſolution muſt be openly, and declaratively; ſo it muſt be <hi>ſolemnly made,</hi> I mean, that you who are now entring into a wicked World, muſt take the firſt Opportunity of an <hi>Epiſcopal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation;</hi> and muſt there in the Face of the World, in the Preſence of the chief Officer in the Church of Chriſt, the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and before the whole Aſſembly of Chriſtians there met, you muſt there, I ſay, as is preſcrib'd in the Office of Confirmation, with your own Mouth and Conſent, <hi>openly recognize,</hi> ratifie, and confirm the ſame Vow that was made for you in your Baptiſm. The Biſhop will then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of you in theſe Words, <q>Do ye here in the Preſence of God, and of this Congregation, renew the ſolemn Promiſe, and Vow, that was made in your Name at your Baptiſm, ratifying and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the ſame in your own Perſons, and acknowledging your ſelves bound to believe, and to do all thoſe things which your Godfathers and Godmothers then undertook for you.</q> And to this Demand every one of you muſt audibly anſwer, <hi>I do:</hi> And ſuch as this, it is probable might be that <hi>good Profeſſion</hi> which <hi>Timothy</hi> had profeſs'd <hi>before many Witneſſes,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.12. So that thus at length you ſee in what conſiſts <hi>Holy Reſolution,</hi> the Importance of theſe Words, <hi>I will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>And I am now to ſhew you, that ſuch Reſolution, and ſo duly form'd as this, is a very powerful means, will go a great way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Performance of our Covenant with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, 1. The very <hi>determining of the Will</hi> with a fix'd, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled purpoſe, has a great force in it to make us put in Execution the moſt difficult part of our Vows and Promiſes. We ſee even in World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Undertakings, where the Advantages are very inconſiderable in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, what Difficulties Men will go through when they are once bent upon a Deſign, whereas, when Perſons have no Will, nor Mind to do a thing, the Wheels of Action move but ſlowly, and their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours are very faint.</p>
                  <p>For why? when Men are fully purpos'd, and are ſet upon a thing, then it is the Subject of their Cares, they lay all their Meaſures, and they muſter up all their Forces to carry it on; and what is equal with all this, they provide againſt all Attempts that ſhall be laid to ruine their Deſigns.</p>
                  <p>And if thoſe who will be Rich, or Great, or Honourable, project a thouſand ways to carry their Point, leave no Stone unturn'd, refuſe no hazards, are diſcourag'd at no Diſappointments and croſs Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; ſhall not we, who have infinitely more valuable Treaſures laid up for us in Heaven; who have Crowns of Glory propos'd to us if we excel in Vertue, ſhall we be faint, and languid in our Endeavours? What can be the reaſon of this, but that in the great Buſineſs of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Men are not ſo much in earneſt, ſo reſolute, and intent, as in the purſuit of their Worldly Advantages and Satisfactions, ſo reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>bent,</hi> I ſay, upon their Improvements in Religious Perfection; for this would go a great way towards their performance of their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God.</p>
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:151517:225"/>
                  <p>Particularly to be fully reſolved upon it, is abſolutely ncceſſary, to baffle, and diſcourage the Devil in all his Attempts upon us; whom in order to <hi>reſist,</hi> the Apoſtle bids us <hi>be ſtedfaſt,</hi> or reſolute <hi>in the Faith,</hi> 1 Pet. 5 9. For indeed ſuch is his Reſolution to deſtroy Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and ſuch eſpecially is his Pride in the Overthrow of the greateſt Heroes in Chriſtianity, that there is no Deviſe, nor Diligence will be wanting on his part to foil you, you eſpecially who are devoted to God; ſo that you muſt <hi>take unto you the whole Armour of God, that ye may be able to withſtand in the Evil-Day, and having done all to ſtand, ſtand therefore having your Loins Girt,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.13.14. which words, and manner of Expreſſion, ſpeak the utmoſt Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be neceſſary. And that will do; for when he ſees that you ſtand ſo much upon your Guard, that he can have no hopes of prevailing; to avoid the ſhame of a foul Defeat, he will at laſt leave you to the Conduct of God's Holy Spirit, and of his Holy Angels, and will no longer moleſt nor trouble you.</p>
                  <p>And the ſame Reſolution is alſo moſt exceedingly neceſſary to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the Luſts of the Fleſh. Theſe are a headſtrong and boiſterous Enemy, and muſt be as reſolutely dealt withal, which our Saviour does more than Intimate, when he tells us, we muſt <hi>Cut off</hi> theſe <hi>Right-Arms,</hi> and <hi>Pluck out theſe Right Eyes of ours,</hi> Matth. 5.29, 30. meaning our moſt darling and beloved Luſts; and to <hi>Cut off,</hi> and <hi>Pluck out</hi> is quick work. And indeed, the only danger from our Luſts is, when we begin to parly with them, and hold Arguments againſt 'em; for in the mean time they inſenſibly ſteal into our Hearts; and get Strength within us; but a Reſolute Reſiſtance, not ſo much as letting 'em enter into our Thoughts, utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats 'em.</p>
                  <p>And, <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The World, eſpecially the <hi>wicked Men</hi> of the World, can by no means be ſo ſucceſsfully defeated in all their Attempts to draw you to Sin, as by your putting on ſerious Reſolutions againſt all ſinful Ways and Courſes. Till then they will never leave you, but will be continually plying you with Inſinuations, Flatteries, Perſwaſions, and Arguments to accompany them in their Riots; but when it once comes to that, that you can ſay with the Reſolved Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.115. <hi>Away from me all ye that work wickedneſs, I will keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of my God,</hi> they will no longer trouble you; they will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you have an Averſion and Hatred to their Ways, and that will natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But, 2. Our Holy Reſolutions are then likelieſt to be firm, and will conſequently prove a happy Inſtrument, and means of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing faithful in your Covenant with God, when they are Ratifi'd and Confirm'd by ſome outward and expreſs <hi>Solemnity,</hi> as at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,</hi> or at a Sacrament. For to the Inward Reſolves of the Mind there will be then added the outward and expreſs Obligation of an Oath, which the Conſciences of all Mankind, not totally deprav'd by Sin, are infinitely afraid of violating. And to this purpoſe, it is obſervable, that even God himſelf, <hi>Willing to ſhew unto the Heirs of Promiſe, the Immutability of his Council, confirm'd it by an Oath, that by two Immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to Lye, we might have ſtrong Conſolation, who have fled for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:151517:226"/> to lay hold on the Hope ſet before us,</hi> Hebrews 6.17, 18. The two immutable things here meant, were the Promiſe, and the Oath of God: And the bare Promiſe of him ſure, <hi>who could not lye</hi> might be ſufficient to give us Aſſurance; But even God himſelf, for our greater Certainty and Conſolation, confirm'd what he promis'd by Oath; which ſhews the <hi>Additional Obligation,</hi> which any thing that carries in it the Nature of an Oath, has upon Mens Conſciences: And therefore it will follow, that your fortifying your Reſolutions at a Confirmation: wherein you ſolemnly ratifie, and renew your Vows to God in the Preſence of his Church, who are Witneſſes to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract that will be produc'd in Judgment againſt you, ſhould you happen to violate the ſame: It will therefore follow, I ſay, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be ſo likely to render your Holy Reſolutions ſtedfaſt, and laſting, as when they are ſo ſolemnly made. By thus ſolemnly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming your Reſolutions, you will give a very great Force, not only to the Dictates of your own Conſciences, but to the Admonitions alſo of your Paſtor, or any other kind Friend, who watches over you for Good, and who then can with <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 26.17, 18. adjure you to be true to your Covenant with God in theſe emphatical, and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Expreſſions, <hi>Thou hast vouched the Lord this day to be thy God, and to walk in his ways, and to keep his Statutes, and to hearken to his Voice. And the Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar People, as he hath promiſed thee, and that thou ſhould'st keep all his Commandments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus I have fully ſhew'd you both the Nature of Holy, and Chriſtian Reſolution; and alſo how much it will conduce to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of your Covenant with God, if you can once bring your ſelves to <hi>Reſolve</hi> well, and eſpecially to ſeal theſe Reſolutions in a publick and ſolemn Ordinance. I ſhall but briefly here ſpeak to the two following Particulars; <hi>viz.</hi> God's <hi>Aſſiſtance,</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> as means alſo of enabling you to diſcharge the ſame. Theſe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed together with Holy Reſolution contain'd in theſe Words;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And by God's help ſo I will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And I pray unto God to give me his Grace, that I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the ſame unto my Lives end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there will be another more proper Occaſion to give a full State, and Account of thoſe two great Points; and therefore I ſhall here inſiſt upon them no farther, than is neceſſary to our preſent purpoſe of ſhewing farther the Nature of Chriſtian Reſolution, and how it muſt be qualify'd. To proceed then,</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>Our Reſolution to be faithful in our Covenant with God, muſt be made, not in Confidence of our own Strength, but of God's Grace and Aſſistance.</hi> Alas, of our ſelves we are extremely weak, all the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Faculties of our Nature being miſerably corrupted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved by Sin, and enfeebled to all that is good: Of our ſelves we are not able ſo much as to think any thing that is good; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we have Sufficiency of God: <hi>And the Truſt we have in God is through Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.4, 5. for he has purchac'd ſufficient Grace and Aſſiſtance for us to help us through all the Difficulties in our Chriſtian Warfare, ſo that tho' we cannot promiſe, nor vow that we will renounce the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, believe in God, and obey him, in Confidence of our own Strength; yet in full Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:151517:226"/> of the Help of God, we may firmly reſolve with a <hi>So I will:</hi> For <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt who ſtrengthens me,</hi> Phil. 4.13. But then,</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>It is Prayer that must obtain that Help and Aſſiſtance,</hi> you muſt <hi>pray unto God to give you his Grace, that you may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the ſame unto your Lives end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prayer is indeed a moſt Sovereign Means of obtaining Supply to all our wants; and they never return unanſwer'd in ſuch a manner as ſhall be beſt for us, provided we our ſelves are duly <hi>qualified</hi> with Tempers and Diſpoſitions to approach unto the Throne of Grace; and provided alſo that the Matter of our Prayer be acceptable to God. But as to his Grace and Aſſiſtance, to enable us to ſerve, and obey him, we may be ſure of never failing in ſuch our Petitions. And therefore you may be particularly aſſur'd that the Prayers of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church, accompany'd with <hi>laying on of Hands,</hi> (to which there is a particular Promiſe of a gracious Anſwer,) will not return empty, when in their <hi>Confirmation</hi> of thoſe amongſt you, who come with ſincere Intentions to perform their Covenant, they ſhall pray unto God to increaſe in you the <q>manifold Gifts of Grace, the Spirit of Wiſdom and Underſtanding, the Spirit of Wiſdom and Ghoſtly Strength, the Spirit of Knowledge and True Godlineſs, and to fill you with the Spirit of Holy Fear now and for ever:</q> Which, and all your Prayers, that they may be ſucceſsful, may God Almighty grant of his Infinite Goodneſs through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>I am now to ſhew you, that it muſt be a Reſolution took up, not in Confidence of our own Strength, but of God's Grace and Aſſiſtance. <hi>And by God's Help ſo I will.</hi>
                     </hi> In order to make which appear,</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

Our <hi>Wills</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Wills</note> they alſo are naturally crooked and perverſe, and altogether for chuſing what pleaſes our Appetites, and our Senſes, and are very backward to Religion and Goodneſs. Our <hi>Affections</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Affections.</note> run with ſo ſtrong a Biaſs towards World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Things, that we cannot eaſily <hi>ſet our Affections on Things above,</hi> as the Apoſtle commands us, <hi>but on Things on Earth.</hi> And laſtly, our <hi>Luſts and Appetites</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luſts and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites.</note> are naturally very evil, and carry us out to pleaſe our Senſes, in direct oppoſition to the Laws of God, and the Dictates of right Reaſon. Thus is our whole Nature corrupt, and every Power and Faculty thereof does incline us to yield to the Temptations of the World, the Fleſh, and Devil, and ſo to ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our God, and to break our Covenant with him. In a word, the Temptations of all ſorts, which we do often meet with to draw us into Sin, are mighty; and the Duties we are to perform in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to 'em all, are many, and ſometimes very difficult; and our own natural Strength, whereby we ſhould do all this, is very weak. <hi>We ſee,</hi> as the Apoſtle words it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. <hi>A Law in our Members, warring againſt the Law of our Minds, and bringing us into Captivity to the Law of Sin, which is in our Members:</hi> So that if we conſider our ſelves as we are in our natural State, we have reaſon to bewail our Condition in the following Words of the Apoſtle; <hi>O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this Body of Sin,</hi> Verſe 24.</p>

And as he has purchac'd it, ſo he does convey it to the Hearts of all ſuch, to enable them to <hi>renounce,</hi> and overcome the <hi>World, the Fleſh, and the Devil; to believe in God, and to obey him:</hi> So that though we are <hi>not ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves, yet we have Sufficiency of God, to enable us both to think, and to do what is good,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.5. And indeed we <hi>can do all things required of us through Chriſt that ſtrengthens us,</hi> Phil. 4.13. And this brings me to my</p>
                  <p>Second Propoſal, <hi>Which was to ſhew you, what the Divine Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aſſiſtance is.</note> 
                     <hi>and what Meaſures of it, Proportionably to ſuch our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, God will beſtow upon us to enable us to perform our Covenant with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as to the <hi>Grace and Aſſiſtance of God,</hi> by it I do mean ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing over and above that Reaſon and Perſwaſiveneſs there is in the Goſpel it ſelf to work a Change in us; whereby on the one hand, by
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:151517:228"/> the propoſal of infinite Rewards to Well-doing; on the other hand, by the threatning of fearful Puniſhments to wicked Living; the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is apt of it ſelf to prevail upon us, and to change our Natures. But by the <hi>Grace and Aſſiſtance of God,</hi> I do mean, I ſay, ſomething over and above this, <hi>viz. A ſecret Power and Efficacy of the Divine Spirit accompanying the Word into the Mind and Will, by means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Goſpel does the more readily and effectually work upon both, to the Renewing of 'em, and to the reſtoring of the Image of God in the Soul; namely, that Righteouſneſs and Purity which we had lost by our Fall.</hi> This I mean by the Divine Aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Meaſures of it proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to the neceſſity of the Church.</note>And as to the meaſures of this Aſſiſtance, every Member in Chriſt's Body, in what Station ſoever he be, ſhall have ſufficient Supplies of Grace derived down from Him our Head, proportionable to his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, by thoſe means of conveying it, which Chriſt has appointed for that purpoſe: I ſay, every Member in Chriſt's Body in what Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſoever he be: <hi>For as we have many Members in one Body, and all Members have not the ſame Office, ſo we being many are one Body in Christ, and every one Members one of another,</hi> Rom. 12.4, 5. that is, there are different Members in the Church of Chriſt. Some are to be Governours and Teachers of others, and accordingly muſt be endow'd with a <hi>Spirit</hi> of Government and <hi>Gift</hi> of Teaching; and others are of a more private Capacity in the Church of Chriſt, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be in other Reſpects, and their Buſineſs is <hi>to keep a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence void of Offence, both towards God and Man,</hi> and faithfully to diſcharge their Duties to God, their Neighbour, and themſelves. And whatever, I ſay, thoſe ſeveral Duties are, which ariſe from their ſeveral Stations in the Church, they ſhall have a competent meaſure of Divine Grace, enabling 'em to diſcharge the ſame. They have not a Promiſe of thoſe Gifts that are neceſſary to the Diſcharge of other Perſons Offices, but are diſtitute of thoſe neceſſary for their own; that is, a private Chriſtian, call'd to no Office in the Church, is not to expect, nor ought to pretend, to have receiv'd <hi>Gifts of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> and <hi>Teaching,</hi> in a publick Miniſterial way, for <hi>God is not the Author of Confuſion, but of Peace in all the Churches of the Saints,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.33. But every Member of the Myſtical Body, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf united to the Head, in ſuch ways as has been ſhew'd, ſhall have ſuch Graces and Aſſiſtances derived down to him from Chriſt, who is that Head, as are neceſſary and proper for him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Gifts of the Spirit in the firſt Ages.</note>And that too in ſuch Meaſures and Proportions, as according to the different Times and Occaſions in the Church, are wanting. Thus in the firſt Plantation of the Goſpel, when the Work was ſo extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, that there was need of Miracles to convince the <hi>Jews</hi> of the Inſufficiency of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law: And the <hi>Gentiles</hi> of the Falſhood of the <hi>Pagan</hi> Superſtition, then did Chriſt beſtow upon his Apoſtles, divers <hi>Extraordinary Gifts,</hi> viz. of <hi>Miracles, Prophecy, diſcerning of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, divers kind of Tongues, and the Interpretation of Tongues,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.10. And as to all Chriſtians in general, as the Malice of Satan did then moſt violently rage againſt the Church, Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Death, thoſe who would not Renounce Chriſt and his Religion; So all the Chriſtians in thoſe Times were very <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily</hi> ſtrengthned, no doubt, to reſiſt ſuch ſtrong Temptations.</p>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:151517:228"/>
                  <p>But now, that the Church is eſtabliſh'd,<note place="margin">Ordinary in ſucceeding Times.</note> and the Truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity already prov'd and Believ'd, God does aſſiſt the Miniſters of Religion only with the <hi>Ordinary Graces</hi> of his Spirit, in the diſcharge of their Miniſtry.</p>
                  <p>And as to Lay Chriſtians therefore, except it be when the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox are call'd out into any part of the World (as ſometimes they are to this day) to ſuffer for the Truth, they receive no other than <hi>ordinary</hi> Aſſiſtances.</p>
                  <p>But this both Miniſters and People are ſure to do, in the uſe of thoſe Means which Chriſt has appointed in his Church for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>And yet even theſe ordinary Aſſiſtances,<note place="margin">Even the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively very large: ſo as to repair all the Powers of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deprav'd by Sin.</note> Bleſſed be the Infinite Mercies of God towards us therein, are <hi>extenſively</hi> very large and diffuſive, ſo as to reach to all the Parts and Powers of our Nature, which are Evilly Affected, Corrupted, and Deprav'd by Sin; and <hi>Intenſively</hi> very powerful in working a bleſſed-Change within us.</p>
                  <p>And, <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Grace of God is <hi>extenſively</hi> very diffuſive and large in the Change and Reformation it works within us, in that there is no Power and Difficulty in our Natures, which by Sin is Corrupted, but by his Grace and Aſſiſtance is Renew'd. I do mean, that the Aſſiſtances which God does afford us to enable our Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to perform the Conditions of the Covenant, is ſo apply'd to us by the Goodneſs of God, that every Power and Faculty within us, which is render'd weak by the Corruption of our Nature, is ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his Grace to perform its proper part and Duty. Are our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings dull to apprehend and conceive of Spiritual things as they ought? His Grace does enlighten our Underſtandings: Thus we read, <hi>Luke</hi> the 24.45. that our Saviour <hi>opened the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of his Diſciples, <hi>that they might underſtand the Scriptures.</hi> And to this purpoſe St. <hi>Paul, Eph.</hi> 1.18. did earneſtly Pray, <hi>That God would give unto 'em the Spirit of Wiſdom, that the Eyes of their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings being enlighten'd, they might know what is the Hope of their Calling, and what are the Riches of the Glory in the Inheritance of the Saints,</hi> Are our Wills backward in performing the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Promiſes, why God by throwing good Suggeſtions into our Souls, and by Imprinting important Conſiderations upon our Minds, does perſwade and bend our ſtubborn Wills, and by degrees, works us into a ready Compliance with the Divine Will: Thus is God ſaid <hi>to work in us both to will and to do, of his good Pleaſure,</hi> Phil. 2.13. And upon this account alſo all our Chriſtian Virtues are call'd, <hi>the Fruits of the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5.22. Are our Affections liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and lukewarm to Spiritual things? particularly, Are they dull and heavy in our Devotions? Why the Holy Spirit helps to raiſe in us Holy Deſires, Liſe, and Quickneſs in our Prayers? Thus the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, the <hi>Spirit helps our Infirmities, making Interceſſion for the Saints, according to the Will of God, by Inſpiring 'em with ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and Groanings that cannot be utter'd,</hi> Rom. 8.26, 27. And, <hi>Lastly,</hi> Are our Luſts and Appetites violent to carry us out to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them in unlawful things? Why? <hi>If by the Spirit of God we ſhall mortifie the Deeds of the Body,</hi> we are Promis'd, that <hi>we ſhall Live,</hi> Rom. 8.13. which implies, that by the Grace and Aſſiſtance

                     <note place="margin">And Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively very pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful to renew our corrupt Natures.</note>And, <hi>Secondly.</hi> The Divine Grace and Aſſiſtance, even in its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Diſtributions, is <hi>Intenſively</hi> powerful, and ſtrong enough to Renew our Corrupt Natures. This ſecret Power of the Holy Spirit does not indeed ſo forcibly and <hi>Irreſiſtably</hi> work a Change in us, as that it will be impoſſible to Reſiſt this Divine Grace and Efficacy, and to render it ineffectual to our Renovation. The Grace of God may be reſiſted, and his Spirit may <hi>ſtrive in vain</hi> with us, no doubt, as it did with the old World, as you may ſee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. yet, by the <hi>opening of the Heart,</hi> as it did the Heart of <hi>Lydia,</hi> ſo that it ſhall <hi>attend to the Word,</hi> Acts 16.14. by fixing of the Mind to conſider, and by enlightning it to diſcern the Nature, Tendency, and Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of things reveal'd in the Goſpel: Alſo by ſweetly diſpoſing the Will to weigh the Importance of Divine Truths, and by giving it to taſte and feel the Goodneſs of Spiritual Things; by theſe Methods it adds ſuch a Perſwaſiveneſs in the Word of God, that the moſt wickedly diſpos'd Perſons ſhall be thereby Converted and chang'd into moſt Vertuous and Good Tempers. Hence from this powerful Concurrence and Co-operation of Grace, whereby it has an Edge given it to pierce the moſt ſtony'd, harden'd Hearts of Men, is the Word of God ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. <hi>To be quick, and powerful, and ſharper than any two-edg'd Sword, piercing even to the dividing aſunder of Soul and Spirit, and of the Joynts, and Marrow; and that is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerner of the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hence St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the Goſpel, which he preach'd unto the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1.5. tells them, that <hi>the Goſpel came not unto them in Word only, but alſo in Power, and in the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> that is, it came accompany'd not only with the Power of Miracles, as ſome do interpret it, but with a great internal Power and Efficacy of the Holy Spirit, working in the Hearts of thoſe to whom it was preach'd, as others do rightly expound it. It came indeed accompany'd with both in thoſe days, both the <hi>Extraordinary Gifts,</hi> and the more <hi>Ordinary</hi> Graces of the Holy Spirit made way for its Entrance, and Entertainment in their Hearts. And ſo great is the Meaſure of Grace afforded now under, and accompanying the preaching of the Goſpel, to what was given under the Law, that the Goſpel is dignify'd, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3, 6. with the Title of Spirit, whereas the Law is ſtil'd the Letter; the Apoſtle making this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt 'em, that <hi>the Letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth Life.</hi> Here the Goſpel is call'd by this Title of the Spirit, ſays a learned Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator, becauſe Grace is a Gift of the Spirit, and is now joined to the Goſpel, which was not to the Law; which Adminiſtration of the Spirit, and annexing of it to the Word under the Goſpel, gives Men the Means to attain Eternal Life; when the Law is the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and by accident the Cauſe of Death to 'em, in denouncing Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt Sinners, and yet not giving Strength to obey. And indeed, laſtly, well may it be ſtil'd the <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſince ſo great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Grace is afforded us now under the Goſpel, to work in us a Change and Reformation; and ſo main and principal a Means is the Grace of God of ſuch a Change, that the whole Work of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:151517:229"/> is call'd, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5, 6. the <hi>renewing of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and ſo little Efficacy is attributed barely to the preaching of the Word, in compariſon of what is attributed to the Grace of God going along with it, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3.7. who by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring one Teacher above another, and dividing into Parties and Factions thereupon, ſeem'd to impute the whole Succeſs to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of ſome Men's Preaching above others: He tells them, that <hi>neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the Increaſe;</hi> where the whole Succeſs of our Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in rendring it effectual, he tells us, is from God's Grace, not from our Skill who preach it: So that <hi>intenſively,</hi> it appears God's Grace is very ſtrong, mighty, and powerful, in working a Change and Reformation in us.</p>
                  <p>To conclude then this Second Means of performing our Covenant with God: As great as our natural Weakneſs is ſince our Fall, you ſee we have the Grace and Aſſiſtance of God ready at hand to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore in us the Image of God, conſiſting in that Righteouſneſs from which we fell by Tranſgreſſion. We ſhall have that Grace and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, I ſay, which is extenſively very diffuſive and large, ſo as to renew in us all thoſe Powers and Faculties of our Nature, which by Sin have been deprav'd; and intenſively very ſtrong, mighty, and powerful in working a Change and Reformation within us. And this is a ſecond Means whereby we ſhall be enabled to perform our Covenant with God.</p>
                  <p>The Third Means whereby we ſhall both obtain the Divine Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and be thereby enabled to diſcharge our Covenant, is Prayer unto God to give us his Grace, that we may continue faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in our Covenant unto our Live's End. But of the Efficacy of Prayer, I ſhall ſpeak the next Opportuntty.</p>

                     <hi>THE XXIX Lecture.</hi> And I pray unto God to give me his Grace, that I may continue in the ſame unto my Live's End.</head>
                  <p>HAving fully explained to you (ſo far as lead thereunto by the Words of our Church-Catechiſm, in the Preliminary Queſtions and Anſwers thereof,) the Nature, Terms, and Conditions of the Covenant of Grace, the Solemnity whereby you enter'd into it, and the mighty Obligations lying upon you to perform it; I am now upon ſhewing you the <hi>Means</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſhall be enabled to perform this ſo important a Covenant, wherein all our Happineſs both in this and the other World, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd and wrapp'd up; a thing indeed, which it does exceedingly concern you to be well inform'd about, it being impoſſible to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any thing as it ought, without the Knowledge of its due and proper Means.</p>
                  <p>And the Firſt Means, in order to perform your Covenant as I have ſhow'd you, is a Holy, Chriſtian, and Firm Reſolution to be faithful in the ſame; the Importance of theſe Words, <hi>So I will.</hi> But a Reſolution it muſt be, which is taken up not in Confidence of our own Strength, but of God's Help. And therefore,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The next neceſſary Means to enable us to diſcharge our part of this Covenant, muſt be the Grace and Aſſiſtance of God, which you have taught you in theſe Words; <hi>And by God's Help ſo I will.</hi> And concerning this, I have alſo ſpoke all that I think is neceſſary to be ſhew'd you in this Place: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1st. I have declar'd to you in what Neceſſity we do ſtand, by reaſon of our own Natural Weakneſs, of the Divine Aſſiſtance, to enable us to overcome the Temptations of the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, and to perform our Covenant with God. And,</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="309" facs="tcp:151517:230"/>2dly, I have ſhew'd you what the Divine Aſſiſtance is, and what Meaſures of it, proportionably to ſuch our Neceſſity, God will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon us to enable us to perform our Covenant with him.</p>
                  <p>And now the Third Means whereby we ſhall both obtain the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aſſiſtance, and be enabled alſo to diſcharge our Covenant, is <hi>Prayer unto God to give us his Grace, that we may continue faithful in our Covenant unto our Lives end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall not here undertake to treat of the whole Subject of Prayer in the full Extent thereof: This will be more properly done in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Place, when we come in the latter part of the Catechiſm to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Lord's Prayer. For as our moſt Excellent Catechiſm does obſerve this moſt uſeful Method in your Inſtruction, to teach you firſt in general the Terms and Conditions of your Covenant, and all things relating to it, and then to deſcend to a more particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the ſame Points; So we cannot do better, than to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſame Method in the Explication of theſe Points. All that I ſhall therefore do at preſent, ſhall be,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. To ſhew you what is meant by praying unto God.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. To lay before you how effectual a Means of performing your Covenant praying unto God will be; not only as it will morally diſpoſe, nay, naturally enforce, and lay a neceſſity upon you to be faithful therein, but as it will certainly procure you the Divine Aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And Firſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The full Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> 
                     <hi>I am to ſhew you in a few Words what is meant by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto God.</hi> And by Prayer, I do not here mean in the ſtricteſt ſence of the Words, our Petitions only to Almighty God, wherein we do implore his Goodneſs to beſtow upon us through Chriſt, what he knows to be beſt both for our Bodies and Souls: This indeed is the moſt proper and immediate ſence of the Words, and the ſence that is moſt directly here intended. But however in the largeſt ſence of the Word, I do alſo mean by <hi>Praying,</hi> all that Application we make to the Divine Majeſty, when either by <hi>confeſſing</hi> our Sins unto him we own our ſelves to deſerve his utmoſt Wrath, and the ſevereſt Puniſhments; or by <hi>petitioning</hi> of him, we entreat his Forgiveneſs of the ſame, and that he will ſtrengthen us with his Grace to do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the future; or when by <hi>interceding</hi> for others, we intreat the like Favour of God for them, in the Forgiveneſs of their Sins, and in the Preſervation of their Innocence; or laſtly, when we return him Thanks for whatever Mercies we, or others have receiv'd at his hands. All theſe are ſo many Parts of that General Duty of Prayer; and in whichſoever of theſe Acts of Devotion we apply and addreſs our ſelves to God, we are ſaid to <hi>pray,</hi> as appears in the Inſtance of the <hi>Phariſee</hi> and <hi>Publican;</hi> both which are ſaid to have gone up into the Temple to pray, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.10. as well the <hi>proud Phariſee,</hi> who ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered only his <hi>Thanks to God that he was not as had as other Men were;</hi> as the honeſt <hi>Publican,</hi> who pour'd out his Soul to God in an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Confeſſion of his own Vileneſs, and in an earneſt Petition that
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:151517:231"/> 
                     <hi>God would be merciful to him a Sinner.</hi> Thus you ſee what is meant by praying unto God, and that all the Parts and Acts of Devotion are therein included; though principally and more directly by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto God, is to be underſtood here, our petitioning his Grace and Aſſiſtance.</p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> And I am now to ſhew you, how effectual a Means of performing your Covenant <hi>praying</hi> unto God will be; not only as it will <hi>morally diſpoſe,</hi> nay, and <hi>naturally enforce,</hi> and lay a neceſſity, a reſtraint upon you to be faithful therein, but as it will <hi>certainly procure</hi> for you the Divine Aſſiſtance.</p>

                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>1.</hi> As it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally diſpoſes us to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient unto God.</note>And, 1. I ſay that Prayer will be a very effectual Means to enable you to perform the Covenant of Grace, though we conſider how far it <hi>morally diſpoſes</hi> us to Vertue and Goodneſs. In Prayer we draw near to God, we approach the Divine Preſence, we hold Communion with him: And thoſe who conſider that thus they do in Prayer, how can they think of not quitting their Sins, which render them ſo odious, ſo hateful to God, into whoſe Preſence no impure thing muſt preſume to enter? It is obſervable what a mighty Influence it will have upon a Man, to be often in the Company of one whom the Spirit of God has greatly ſanctify'd, into whoſe Soul the Divine Image is manifeſtly reſtored, and who is more than ordinarily emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for his Piety, Sobriety, Humility, Juſtice, and Charity. The ſhining Graces and Vertues of ſuch a Perſon, will ſtrike an awful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Veneration into the Hearts of all that come near him, ſo that they dare not offer at, nor ſo much as think of any wicked, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, unchaſt, or other villainous Action in his Preſence; and when gone from him, there is ſcarcely any ſo reprobate, but will carry off ſome good Diſpoſitions to the like Vertues ſo eminent in that Perſon. And how then can any appear before God, who is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity, and not be put into the moſt holy Frame and Temper of Mind? It is but to be frequent with God in Prayer, and it would inſenſibly mould us into a like Heavenly Temper and Frame of Spirit, and at length work in us a Divine Nature.</p>

                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>2</hi> As it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ally enforces us to be faithful to him.</note>Nay, 2. conſtant Prayer will more than diſpoſe us; it will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inforce us to be faithful with God. I mean it is a Duty of that Nature, that it is ſcarcely to be imagin'd how any one ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in Prayer, and yet perſevere withal to violate his Covenant with God: For why? <hi>If I regard Iniquity in my heart;</hi> that is, if I do not repent of it, and turn away from it, <hi>the Lord will not hear me,</hi> Pſal. 66.18. Nay, the Wiſe Man tells us, that <hi>he who turns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Ear from hearing the Law, that his Prayer ſhall be even an Abomination to the Lord,</hi> Prov. 28.9. So that whilſt a Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues impenitent, his Prayers, inſtead of appeaſing, will but the more inflame the Wrath of God againſt him.</p>
                  <p>And good reaſon why; for conſider all the Parts of Prayer, and you will find they are but <hi>meer Mockery</hi> out of the unhallowed Mouths of Impenitent Sinners; for what leſs than the vileſt Mockery can it be, for any one, whilſt he allows himſelf in any Wickedneſs, to come gravely into God's Preſence, and there confeſs before him, that <hi>he has
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:151517:231"/> offended againſt his Holy Laws;</hi> that <hi>he has left undone thoſe things which he ought to have done,</hi> and that <hi>he has done thoſe things which he ought not to have done;</hi> and yet notwithſtanding all this, deſigns no otherwiſe, than to offend him in like manner again? And how impudently it is to affront God to the Face; for any impenitent Wretch to put up ſuch Petitions as theſe, But do thou, O Lord, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I have ſinn'd, and will continue yet to ſin (for this is the true Import of a wicked Man's Prayers, neither more nor leſs) <hi>have Mercy upon me a miſerable Offender?</hi> And tho' he is far from repenting, yet to ſay, <hi>Spare thou me that confeſs my Faults, Reſtore thou me that am penitent?</hi> And again, with what Confidence can wicked Chriſtians pretend to <hi>interceed</hi> with God for his Favours to <hi>Jews, Turks, Infidels, and Hereticks,</hi> when alas they are much leſs the Favourites of God themſelves; and <hi>it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the Day of Judgment,</hi> than for wicked Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.24. I do confeſs indeed, as to that part of Prayer which we call Thankſgiving, the moſt wicked and impenitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners may <hi>bleſs God for their Creation, Preſervation, and all the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of this Life: For he maketh his Sun to riſe on the Evil, and on the Good; and ſendeth Rain on the Juſt, and on the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt,</hi> Matth. 5.45; and there's nothing hinders but they ſhould praiſe him for it.</p>
                  <p>But with what ſhew of Sincerity can they be thought to <hi>bleſs him above all for his ineſtimable Love in his Redemption of the World by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for the means of Grace, and for the hopes of Glory;</hi> when ſo long as they continue in their Sins, they can expect no benefit from Chriſt's Redemption, and can have no hopes of Glory?</p>
                  <p>True it is, there have been obſerv'd in the World,<note place="margin">That there are praying Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, is by virtue of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomian Principles.</note> both in our Saviour's Time, and of latter days, a ſort of Impious and Prophane Wretches, that have been greatly given to Pray, and yet have been moſt notorious Lyars and Slanderers; Proud and Cenſorious; and above all, moſt cruel and unmerciful Exactors and Oppreſſors; but it is plain, they were either Hypocrites and Atheiſts in the bottom, and for a pretence and colour only, made <hi>long Prayers, that they might more eaſily devour Widows Houſes,</hi> Matth. 23.14. and ſo by the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of their Sanctity delude unwary People to truſt 'em, till ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving 'em within their Power, they might grind 'em to Powder. Or they owe this to ſome other Wicked and Heretical Principles, as our Modern <hi>Antinomians,</hi> who do found their favour with God in his <hi>Arbitrary Election</hi> of their Perſons, without any reſpect had to their Virtues and Graces, as acceptable through the Mediation of Chriſt; and will therefore pretend to pray to him; nay, and in their Prayers preſume to talk with him, as familiarly as one Friend does to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But alas, the Scripture gives none the leaſt grounds for ſuch Confidence and Preſumption; but does indeed let us know, it is a fearful thing to preſume to pray to God, and at the ſame time to continue in Sin.</p>
                  <p>Sacrifices amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> were a kind of <hi>ſenſible and viſible Prayers,</hi> and Prayers did uſually accompany them; but whilſt that People were notoriouſly wicked, ſee how God does expreſs his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of ſuch their Sacrifices and Prayers, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66.3. <hi>He that killeth an Oxe, is as if he ſlew a Man; he that Sacrificeth a Lamb, as
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:151517:232"/> if he cut off a Dogs Neck; he that Offereth an Oblation, as if he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Swines Blood; he that burneth Incenſe, as if he bleſſed an Idol.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that there is a great neceſſity of Reſolving to forſake Sin, and of being faithful in our Covenant, if we will pray to God, but if Men will go on wilfully in ſinful Courſes, they had e'en as good not pray at all. Heaven and Hell, Light and Darkneſs may be joyn'd together, and Reconcil'd, as well as Prayer and Impenitence.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>3.</hi> As it will certainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</note>3. And eſpecially, Prayer duly qualify'd, will be a moſt effectual Means to enable you to diſcharge your Covenant, as it procures for you the Grace and Aſſiſtance of God, without which you cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, as has already been ſhew'd you. I ſay, if duly Qualify'd, if put up with Faith and Sincerity; for as appears from the laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, the Prayers of ſuch as are reſolvedly Wicked will avail no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to their greater Damnation. But otherwiſe Prayer doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs is the moſt prevalent thing in the World with God, to derive down his Bleſſings, Favours, and Graces of all ſorts upon us. <q>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſaith the Learned and Pious Biſhop <hi>Taylor,</hi> hath ſaved Cities and Kingdoms from Ruine. Prayer hath raiſed Dead Men to Life, hath ſtopped the violence of Fire, and ſhut the Mouths of wild Beaſts: It hath alter'd the courſe of Nature, hath cauſed Rain in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and Drought in the Sea: It made the Sun to go back from <hi>Weſt</hi> to <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and the Moon to ſtand ſtill, and Rocks and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to walk; and it cures Diſeaſes without Phyſick, and makes Phyſick to do the work of Nature; and, in a word, does many Miracles.</q> But of all the Miracles that Prayer doth, there is none ſo valuable, (if any ſo great) as to Sanctify our Natures, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to perform our Covenant with God, which Prayer is a moſt effectual means to enable us to do.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, That Prayer will moſt effectually procure for us the Graces of the Holy Spirit, to enable us to perform our Covenant with God, of which we have a moſt full and pregnant Proof, <hi>Luke</hi> 11, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. our bleſſed Saviour, in the foregoing Verſes, having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his Diſciples a Prayer to learn, to enforce upon 'em the conſtant and devout Exerciſe of this moſt Heavenly Duty, tells 'em, by way of Parable, how prevalent an Importunate Prayer will be, even with an Ill-natur'd Man, to incline him to grant the Deſires of him that Petitions him. And then he proceeds to tell 'em, That much more will Conſtancy, and Earneſtneſs in Prayer, prevail upon God, who is more tender to us, and more forward of himſelf to do us good, than our very Parents. <hi>And I ſay unto you, Ask and ye ſhall have, ſeek, and ye ſhall find, knock, and it ſhall be open'd unto you; for every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that ſeeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh it ſhall be opened. If a Son ſhall ask Brea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of any of you, that is a Father, will he give him a Stone; or if he ask a Fiſh, will he for a Fiſh give him a Serpent; or if he ſhall ask an Egg, will he offer him a Scorpion? If ye then being Evil, know how to give good Gifts unto your Children, how much more ſhall your Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> Which is as if he ſhould ſay, There is no fear that God ſhould deny ſuch Petitions, or give his Children any hurtful thing, when they ask that which is good for
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:151517:232"/> them: And tho' many things, which Men ask, be not good, yet his Spirit, and the Aſſiſtances of it are ſo undoubtedly ſuch, that they will never be deny'd to them that ask them of the Father. This is ſo full a proof of the prevalency of Prayer to procure of God the Grace of his Holy Spirit, to ſanctifie our Natures, and to enable us to perform the Conditions of our Covenant, that it would be e'en loſt labour to multiply any more Texts to this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>What then remains, but that we therefore moſt earneſtly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly Pray unto God, that he would <hi>Sanctifie our Natures,</hi> that he would <hi>grant unto us according to the Riches of his Grace, to be strengthen'd with Might by his Spirit in the inward Man.</hi> Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore Pray, that he would <hi>Sanctifie our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings,</hi> that being transform'd by the renewing of our Minds, we may be able to have a Spiritual diſcerning of the things of God, <hi>being wiſe to that which is good, but ſimple and harmleſs to that which is Evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us therefore Pray, that he would <hi>Sanctifie and Reform our Wills,</hi> that we may in every thing ſubmit them unto his; delighting to do his Will. <hi>Not ſeeking our own Will, but the Will of him that ſent us,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And let us therefore Pray, that he would <hi>Sanctifie and Circumciſe our Hearts, that we may ſet our Affections on things above, and not on Earthly Matters,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Farther yet, Let us therefore particularly pray, that having San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify'd us throughly in our Underſtandings, Wills, and Affections, he would enable us to perform each of the Conditions of our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p>That he would ſtrengthen our Faith, and enable us to <hi>hold the Profeſſion of our Faith without wavering,</hi> that he would grant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us Repentance, <hi>That no longer ſpending the reſt of our Time in the Fleſh, to the Luſts of Men, but to the Will of God, the time paſt of our Lives may ſuffice to have ſerved divers Luſts,</hi> and that for the future we may walk as Obedient Children, <hi>not faſhioning our ſelves according to the former Luſts in our Ignorance; but as he who hath called us is Holy, ſo we may be Holy in all manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Let us pray unto him to give us his Grace, that we may thus continue, and perſevere in Repentance, Faith, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto our Lives end; that <hi>being ſtedfaſt and unmovable, always abounding in the Work of the Lord, we may patiently continme in well-doing,</hi> without wearineſs, <hi>as knowing that in due time we ſhall reap, if we faint not;</hi> which that we may do, God Almighty grant of his infinite Mercy, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, to whom, and the Holy Ghoſt, be aſcribed all Might, Majeſty, and Dominion, both now and for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <hi>THE XXX Lecture.</hi> VVherein I was made.</head>
                  <p>IN ſeveral foregoing Lectures upon the Words of the Catechiſm, having explained all that I ſuppoſe neceſſary to be known by you, concerning the general Nature and Subſtance of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, the <hi>Solemnity</hi> whereby you entred into it, the Obligations upon you to perform it, and the Means whereby you ſhall be enabled to diſcharge it: I come now to do the like as to thoſe Circumſtances relating to your entrance into it, and requiſite alſo to be conſider'd by you.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Circumſtances are Two: Firſt, <hi>The Time when.</hi> Secondly, <hi>The Perſons by whom, as by Proxies you were Initiated into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>I will conſider the Time when;</hi> which, becauſe it was as to moſt of you, in your Infancy, as is imply'd in theſe words, <hi>Wherein I was made,</hi> a Time thought unſeaſonable by ſome Perſons for ſo grand an Undertaking; therefore I will endeavour to Juſtifie the having been admitted into the Covenant of Grace, by Baptiſm, in the time of your Infancy. This, I ſay, is what theſe words, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I was made,</hi> do ſignifie to us, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was ſometime here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, that you were <hi>Baptized,</hi> and entred into Covenant with God, which was, you know, as to the Children of moſt Believers, in the Age of Infancy. And now, I will juſtifie the thing, the being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Covenant of Grace by Baptiſm <hi>(If the Children of Believing Parents)</hi> even at ſuch an Age.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Children of Believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have a right to be Baptized, prov'd from <hi>1 Cor. 7.14.</hi>
                     </note>I ſay, <hi>If the Children of Believing Parents;</hi> for that ſuch have a greater Priviledge than others, and with reference to this very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, of being Baptized, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>onfederated with God, may be very fairly gathered from that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.14. <hi>For the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Husband is Sanctify'd by the Wife; and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelieving Wife is Sanctify'd by the Husband, elſe were your Children unclean, but now are they Holy;</hi> for the underſtanding which difficult place, we muſt
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:151517:233"/> conſider the occaſion of the Words, and the import of this Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Elſe were your Children unclean, but now are they Holy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, the occaſion of the Words, was a Queſtion propounded to the Apoſtle, Whether a Believing Wife, or Husband, ought to dwell with an Unbeliever; which the Apoſtle reſolves, that either of 'em might, and uſes this Argument for it, That the Unbeliever may, by the Converſation and Perſwaſion of his Wife, in time be Sanctify'd, and Converted himſelf to Chriſtianity; however, if he be not, his Children on the account of the Mother, being a Chriſtian, are not <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean,</hi> but <hi>Holy;</hi> for the underſtanding of which Expreſſion, it is to be conſider'd, that there is a twofold <hi>Holineſs</hi> aſcribed to Perſons in the New Teſtament, to omit ſome other Acceptations in the Old.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is a <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Inherent Holineſs,</hi> which is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Qualification to make us capable of Happineſs in the Life to come, and Members of the Church Triumphant in Heaven, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of St. <hi>Paul, Without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12.14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is a <hi>Relative,</hi> and outward, or <hi>Privilegial Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> upon the account of Perſons being <hi>ſeperated</hi> from the reſt of the World, to the pure and Holy Service, of a pure and Holy God; ſuch as is the Holineſs of all the Members of the <hi>Church Militant</hi> here on Earth, thoſe I mean who are called into the Covenant of Grace, as you may ſee, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. where ſpeaking to the whole <hi>Catholick Church</hi> of Chriſtians, as Chriſtians, he calls 'em a <hi>Choſen Generation, a Royal Prieſthood, a Holy Nation, a peculiar People. A Holy Nation</hi> do ye ſee he calls 'em, which was ſpoke on the account of that Holy Profeſſion they were Baptized into, tho' all of 'em, in their own Perſons, were not <hi>Inherently</hi> Holy, no more than all that are called to the Profeſſion of the Goſpel, are choſen to the Salvation of it. So that by theſe Expreſſions, <hi>Elſe were your Children <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean, but now are they Holy,</hi> muſt be meant a <hi>Relative</hi> and <hi>Privilegial Holineſs</hi> they have, by being deſcended from a Chriſtian Parent, whereby they are capable of being Members of the Catholick Church, that <hi>Holy Nation meant</hi> in St. <hi>Peter;</hi> capable, I ſay, of being made ſo by Baptiſm, the only Door of entrance into it.</p>
                  <p>And if the Children, even of one <hi>Believing</hi> Parent, are thus <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively</hi> and <hi>Privilegially Holy,</hi> by being within the Covenant, or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being took into it by Baptiſm, on the account of having one Chriſtian Parent, much more ſhould the Children of thoſe be ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, both of whoſe Parents are Chriſtians. Poſſibly one reaſon wherefore the Child of one Chriſtian Parent is thus Holy, as to be reputed capable to be a Covenanted Member of Chriſt's Church, is, becauſe it may be fairly preſum'd, the Chriſtian Parents Zeal for God's Glory, will make He or She train up that Child to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and Belief, and Service of the One <hi>True God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt:</hi> And if it may be fairly preſum'd, that where there is but one Chriſtian Parent, that Pious Care will be there taken; much more may it, where both are Chriſtians. So that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of ſuch Parents as are both of 'em Chriſtians, muſt have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Right to be Baptized into the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                  <pb n="316" facs="tcp:151517:234"/>
                  <p>This remarkable Scripture does indeed, to any unprejudic'd Mind, if put into its true Light, ſufficiently prove it to be the peculiar Priviledge of Chriſtians Children to be took into Covenant with God; however, the moſt prejudic'd cannot deny, but that from hence it does appear, they have ſome Priviledge more than ordinary, above the Children of meer Heathens. And that this is their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that they may be Confederated with God in Baptiſm, even in their very Infancy, I will farther prove from theſe following Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and by proceeding gradually by theſe ſeveral Steps, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">May be prov'd alſo from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Topicks.</note>I. That Infants were Initiated by Circumciſion into that Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Covenant made with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. That they were Initiated both by Circumciſion and Baptiſm, into that legal one deliver'd by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. That it was, without all doubt, the Intention of our Saviour, that under the Goſpel likewiſe, they ſhould be Baptized into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. That agreeably to the Mind of their Maſter, the Baptizing of 'em into it, was, in all probability, practic'd by the Apoſtles of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. That it is very agreeable to the Ends and Reaſon of Baptiſm, and the Nature of the Covenant of Grace, that they ſhould be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into it. And,</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That it is a Happy, a mighty Advantage for thoſe Infants, that have been at that Age Baptized into it. All which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, when I ſhall have made out, more perhaps may be, but I do not know any thing farther that need be ſaid, to Juſtifie Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. And,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe Infants were Initiated by Circumciſion into the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                     </note>I. <hi>I am to ſhew you, that Infants were Initiated by Circumciſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Evangelical Covenant made with</hi> Abraham.</p>
                  <p>I do call the Covenant God made with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Almighty promis'd to be <hi>a God unto him, and his Seed after him,</hi> ver. 7. <hi>and that in his Seed all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be Bleſſed:</hi> And <hi>Abraham,</hi> on the other ſide, Believing God, was to leave his Father's Houſe, and Country, and Kindred, and their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3. I do call this, I ſay, an <hi>Evangelical Covenant,</hi> having the Authority of an Apoſtle for it, who tells us, it was <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed before of God in Chriſt,</hi> and diſtinguiſhes it from that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant deliver'd by <hi>Moſes,</hi> Gal. 3.17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Covenant made with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> the ſame in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with the <hi>2</hi> made with <hi>Adam.</hi>
                     </note>It was indeed the ſame <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and in ſomething a clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer Edition of it, that was made with <hi>Adam</hi> ſoon after his Fall, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God vouchſafed to reſtore him to a State of Salvation, in that Promiſe of the <hi>Seed of the Woman;</hi> that is, the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> which ſhould <hi>bruiſe the Serpent's head;</hi> that is, the Devil. It was the ſame Covenant of Grace, I ſay, and expreſt indeed in ſomething clearer
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:151517:234"/> Terms, than at firſt in that Promiſe to <hi>Adam;</hi> for ſtill the nearer the <hi>Son of Righteouſneſs</hi> did approach <hi>with healing under his wings,</hi> the more full were the manifeſtations he was pleas'd to make of this Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and the Methods of it. And it contained under theſe Words,<note place="margin">And the ſame in a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it with that made with Chriſt.</note> 
                     <hi>And in thy Seed ſhall all Families of the Earth be bleſſed,</hi> Gen. 12.3. All the Goſpel-Promiſes of Pardon, Juſtification, and Happineſs, couched more darkly, than afterwards they were revealed in the Goſpel; for by the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>'s conferring of theſe things, as has appeared ſince the preaching of the Goſpel, <hi>Abraham,</hi> and we, and all his Spiritual Seed, are <hi>bleſſed.</hi> And it had the ſame Conditions, on the performance of which theſe Promiſes did depend, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith; for <hi>Abraham believed in the Lord, and it was accounted unto him for Righteouſneſs,</hi> Gen. 15.6. And laſtly, Circumciſion, the Seal of this Covenant, is call'd the <hi>Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, Rom.</hi> 4.11. that is, the Seal of that Covenant, whoſe Condition is ſuch a Righteouſneſs as proceeds from Faith, which is the very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Goſpel-Covenant: All which do manifeſtly ſhew, that the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> was that very Evangelical Goſpel-Covenant, revealed afterwards more fully in the Goſpel it ſelf; and which was eſtabliſh'd by the Mediation of Chriſt, betwixt God and us.</p>
                  <p>And now that Infants, even at eight Days old, were to be initiated into this Covenant by Circumciſion, is to be ſeen, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.11, 12. <hi>And ye ſhall circumciſe the Fleſh of your Fore-skin, and it ſhall be a Token of the Covenant betwixt me and you; and he that is eight days old ſhall be circumciſed amongſt you,</hi> Nay, and ſo indiſpenſable was this Circumciſion, even at eight days old, that it is declared, <hi>Verſe</hi> 14. that <hi>the uncircumciſed Male-Child, whoſe Fleſh of his Fore-skin is not circumciſed, that that Soul ſhould be cut off from his People; he hath broken his Covenant.</hi> So that I think it is plain, that as the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> was no other than the Evangelical Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in a more imperfect Edition of it; ſo Infants were of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, under the greateſt Penalties of being debarr'd all benefits from it, to be initiated into it, by the outward Rite, and Seal of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.</p>
                  <p>And now this I take to be a very good Argument to juſtifie, nay, to neceſſitate the Baptizing of Infants now under the more compleat and perfect manifeſtation of the Covenant of Grace. For why ſhould any one imagine, if it were no unreaſonable thing, for Children of eight days old to be initiated into it then, by an outward Right or Ceremony, why, I ſay, ſhould any one think it ſhould be ſo now? Nor is it at all material, that then it was by Circumciſion, now by Baptiſm; for both of 'em are equally outward Rites and Seals of the ſame Covenant; which Rite of Circumciſion, God was pleas'd to change for that of Baptiſm, only becauſe this latter would be more agreeable to both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">As he was cut off from the Covenant, who was not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed; ſo that Perſon is to be excluded the Church, who is not baptized.</note> deſign'd now to be took into the Covenant of Grace; and who, for the moſt part, would not have endured Circumciſion, which was abominable, and a matter of Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the greateſt part of the Heathen World.</p>
                  <p>And was it then declar'd, <hi>Gen,</hi> 17.14. that the <hi>uncircumcis'd Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child, whoſe Fleſh of his Fore-skin was not circumciſed, that that Soul ſhould be cut off from his People,</hi> as one that had broken his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:151517:235"/> and may it not be thought now a Matter of indiſpenſable Duty and Neceſſity, to baptize Children into the Covenant; and a thing extremely dangerous and prejudicial to their Happineſs, to deny it 'em? I am ſure it is not for want of Scripture-Evidence, that we ſhould not think Baptiſm as neceſſary now, as Circumciſion was then; ſince the ſame Word of Truth hath told us, <hi>except we be born of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and of the Spirit, we cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, Joh.</hi> 3.5. So that thoſe miſguided Parents do not know what infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite prejudice they do their Infant-Children, in denying them the Privilege of baptizing them into the Covenant of Grace; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they may not be a means of debarring them of all thoſe ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Benefits, Chriſt has purchaſed with his Blood for us, and which he enſures only to thoſe who are in Covenant with him.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>2.</hi> Becauſe they were ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated both by Circumciſion and Baptiſm into that legal one delivered by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     </note>II. <hi>And as Infants were circumciſed into that Evangelical Covenant made with</hi> Abraham; <hi>ſo they were both circumciſed, and alſo baptized into that legal one delivered by</hi> Moſes. The <hi>Legal</hi> Covenant delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>Moſes,</hi> is frequently diſtinguiſh'd by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace confirmed with <hi>Abraham.</hi> Thus, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. <hi>This I ſay, that the Covenant that was before confirmed of God with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham in Chriſt, the Law which was</hi> 430 <hi>Years after, cannot diſanull, that it ſhould make the Promiſe, or Covenant of Grace</hi> (which is ſo call'd, to ſignifie the gracious Nature of it, as being made very much up of moſt gracious Promiſes) <hi>of none effect.</hi> Here the Legal Covenant is diſtinguiſh'd, both in Time, as being given 430 years after; and in point of efficacy, as that which is not of that force, as to diſanull the other more weighty, and important Covenant made with <hi>Abraham.</hi> It is uſual ſometimes for after-Covenants to diſannul former ones; but it ſeems it was not ſo here; but this <hi>Legal Covenant</hi> given after, was ſuperinduc'd upon the other ſtill remaining in force, as the only one by which Salvation was to be expected.</p>
                  <p>And the Enquiry might well be, to what End this <hi>Legal Covenant</hi> was added, like an Appendix, as it were, and <hi>Codicill</hi> to the former Will? And not here to give a full Account of all the Ends and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of it, which is beſides our preſent purpoſe; my Anſwer to the Queſtion, <hi>Wherefore then ſerveth the Law,</hi> ſhall be with St. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 3.19. <hi>that it was added becauſe of Tranſgreſſions, until the Seed ſhould come. It was added becauſe of Tranſgreſſions;</hi> that is, to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the multitude, and heinouſneſs, and guilt of Sin, for the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the perfect Rule of Righteouſneſs, made it eaſie for Perſons, comparing their own Lives therewith, to find out how infinitely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective they were. And <hi>it was added till the Seed ſhould come:</hi> It ſhewed them therefore, by giving 'em a ſight of their Sins, how much they ſtood in need of a Saviour. And the Sacrifices, Offerings, and Rituals of it, which were very many, were, for the moſt part, but Types and Shadows of this Saviour to come. This may ſuffice at preſent, as to the <hi>Legal Covenant,</hi> and the Reaſons of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">That they were admitted by Circumciſion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ndiſputable.</note>And now let us enquire, whether Infants, during the time of this <hi>Legal Covenant</hi> delivered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> were not admitted into it, as well as grown Perſons, by ſome outward Rites and Solemnities? And that we ſhall ſee they were, both by <hi>Circumciſion</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> That In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of eight days old were of neceſſity to be circumciſed, was po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:151517:235"/> commanded, <hi>Lev.</hi> 12.3. <hi>And in the eighth day, the Fleſh of his Fore-skin ſhall be circumciſed;</hi> which Circumciſion was an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement upon them to <hi>keep the whole Law, Gal.</hi> 5.3. But that the Infants in the Jewiſh Church were circumciſed, even at eight days old, is ſo evident a Truth to thoſe that do themſelves read, or hear the Scriptures read, that I need not certainly ſpend time in proving of it.</p>
                  <p>But that they were baptized,<note place="margin">That they were alſo by Baptiſm aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both by Scripture.</note> is not indeed ſo commonly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and known, but wants not its Evidence even from Scripture: As, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1, 2. where St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>All our Fathers were under the Cloud, and all paſſed through the Sea, and were all baptized unto Moſes;</hi> that is, the Religion of <hi>Moſes, in the Cloud, and in the Sea.</hi> And that their very Infants, as well as their Parents, were ſo baptized, is certain, for that <hi>all were alike under the Cloud, and in the Sea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I think it is generally agreed amongſt the Learned,<note place="margin">And by Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Writers.</note> that as the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> during their whole Travels through the Red Sea, and Wilderneſs, were not circumciſed, becauſe it would make them ſore for travelling; ſo inſtead thereof, that they were <hi>baptized,</hi> or admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Covenant by <hi>Baptiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But eſpecially they tell us, it was uſed for the Admiſſion of Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes, or thoſe who had been before <hi>Aliens and Strangers from the Commonwealth of Iſrael,</hi> that it was eſpecially uſed for the Admiſſion of ſuch into the Covenants and Promiſes. And the Original uſe of it to this end, ſome aſcribe to the Patriarch <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he choſe into his Family and Church the young Women of <hi>Sichem,</hi> and other Heathens, who then lived with him. <hi>Jacob ſaid to his Family, and to all who were with him, put away from you the ſtrange Gods, and be you clean, and change your Garments,</hi> Gen. 35.2. By which Words, <hi>Be ye clean,</hi> ſome do interpret the <hi>waſhing</hi> of the Body, or Baptiſm; which Reaſon it ſelf does alſo perſuade us to believe, as being very proper, when they were to abandon their filthy Idolatry, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the pure Worſhip of the true God.</p>
                  <p>And it is alſo well known to thoſe, who are skill'd in Jewiſh Cuſtoms, that when any Parents,<note place="margin">

Pag. 117.</note> that all the Nation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were brought into the Covenant, among other things by Baptiſm. <hi>Iſrael</hi> (as he cites <hi>Maimonides</hi> in particular) was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Covenant by three things; namely, by <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Baptiſm,</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice.</hi>
                     </q> So that I hope it does ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by what has been ſaid, that Infants in the Jewiſh Church were both circumciſed, and alſo baptized into the Legal Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it of little force, to prove that Chriſtian Infants under the Covenant of Grace, may be baptized, that the Jewiſh Infants were circumciſed, and baptized under the legal: For not now to inſiſt, that circumciſing and baptizing of Infants, and that by God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's own Appointment, does demonſtrate to us, that there is no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:151517:236"/> in an Infant, that he ſhould be admitted into Covenant with God, by ſome outward <hi>Solemnity,</hi> even whilſt an Infant; for if there were any unreaſonableneſs in the thing it ſelf, God would not have ſo order'd it. But not now to inſiſt on this; I do humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it may be fairly gather'd, that if under a more harſh and rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Diſpenſation, Children were ſo far Priviledg'd, as to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Advantages of a Covenant with God, much more are they to be preſum'd to have this Favour granted 'em by God, under that bleſſed and Merciful Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, which, in all reſpects, <hi>is a better Covenant, and eſtabliſh'd upon better Promiſes,</hi> Heb. 8.6. and contains far more enlarged Priviledges. But to proceed, for I deſign not this of the Baptizing of Infants into the <hi>Legal Covenant,</hi> ſo much an Argument to build Infant Baptiſm upon (tho' it is no inconſiderable one of it ſelf to that purpoſe) as a Foundation rather, for a far better proof of the Matter, which is this, that Baptizing of Infants having been practic'd in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>It is a thing well known amongſt the Learned, that the Matter of both the Sacraments were of a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Original, and more of Human than Divine Inſtitution, till made ſo by our Saviour, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding approving of 'em, rejected <hi>Circumciſion</hi> and the <hi>Paſſover</hi> from being the Sacraments of his Religion; and Adopted the Baptiſm of Water, inſtead of Circumciſion; and Bread and Wine inſtead of the Paſſover to be the two Sacraments, the one of <hi>Initiation,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Confirmation</hi> into his Religion and Covenant.

                  <p>Nor was it at all needful, if he deſign'd Infants to be Baptized, he ſhould have given ſome Command about it; for taking it as he found it in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, who Baptized Infants as well as grown Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, this was ſufficient to clear his Deſign, that Infants in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, as well as grown Perſons, ſhould alſo be Baptized, or elſe he would have declared the contrary. <q>The whole Nation knowing well enough,<note place="margin">

                     <p>If a Royal Proclamation ſhould now Iſſue forth in theſe words, Let every one on the Lord's-Day, reſort to the Publick Aſſembly in the Church, certainly he would be Mad, who in times to come, ſhould argue hence, that Prayers, Sermons, Singing of Pſalms, were not to be Celebrated on the Lord's-Day in the Publick Aſſemblies, becauſe there is no mention of them in the Proclamation. For the Proclamation provided for the Celebration of the Lord's-Day, in the Publick Aſſemblies, in general; but there was no need to make mention of the particular Kinds of the Divine Worſhip to be Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated there, when they were always, and every where well known, and in daily uſe, before the Publiſhing of the Proclamation, and when it was Publiſhed. The Caſe is the very ſame in Baptiſm. Chriſt Inſtituted it for an Evangelical Sacrament, whereby all ſhould be admitted into the Profeſſion of the Goſpel, as heretofore it was uſed for admiſſion into <hi>Proſelytiſm</hi> into the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion. The particulars belonging to it, as the manner of Baptizing, the Age, the Sex to be Baptized, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had no need of a Rule or Definition, becauſe theſe were by the common uſe of 'em ſufficiently known, even to the moſt Illiterate and Ignorant Men.</p>
                     <p>On the other-hand therefore, there was need of a plain and open Prohibition, that Infants and little Children ſhould not be Baptized, if our Saviour would not have had 'em Baptized. For ſince it was common in all Ages foregoing, that little Children ſhould be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, if Chriſt had been minded to have that Cuſtom aboliſhed, he would have openly forbidden it. His ſilence therefore, and the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Scripture in this Matter, is the beſt Argument that can be in this Caſe for Infant Baptiſm, and does confirm and continue it unto all Ages.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Thus that Learned Author. And thus to me it ſeems beyond all doubt, that the Intention of our Saviour was, that under the Goſpel likewiſe, as well as before, under the Law, Infants ſhould be Baptized into the Covenant of Grace.</p>

And Circumciſion which was Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed on Infants of Eight Days old, did not only confer on 'em this Priviledge, that they ſhould be God's peculiar People; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, laid upon 'em this Obligation, to obſerve the whole Law; for <hi>I teſtifie for ye, ſaid St.</hi> Paul, <hi>to every Man that is Circumciſed, that he is a Debtor to do the whole Law,</hi> Gal. 5.3. And ſurely, we do daily ſee, that a Man may bind his Heir whilſt an Infant.

We ſee it often ſo Adjudg'd in our Courts of Juſtice: And the Caſe is the very ſame here. The Conditions of the Covenant of Grace are of ſome difficulty, true it is, to be perform'd, yet have ſuch invaluable Benefits annexed to 'em, that the Tongue of Men and Angels are not ſufficient to expreſs the value of 'em; and they were worth our utmoſt endeavours to obtain, tho' by the ſevereſt Penances and Services of a Thouſand Years; and therefore it ought not to be thought any unreaſonable thing, that others ſhould be engag'd in our Name for our performance of ſuch Conditions, or that we ſhould be accounted as Engag'd our ſelves, for what our Guardians, our <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers</hi> and <hi>Godmothers</hi> did Promiſe for us; for this indeed, which was the</p>

Their <hi>Original Sin</hi> is now waſh'd off, and ſhall be no more imputed to 'em; that is, the <hi>former Covenant</hi> which was at firſt Cancell'd, by being <hi>nail'd to the Croſs of Chriſt,</hi> is now particularly
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:151517:238"/> Cancell'd, and put out of any force with reſpect to them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Baptized, and thereby enter'd into a <hi>Covenant of Grace;</hi> ſo that whatever Guilt might have been imputed unto 'em, by reaſon of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſgreſſion, ſhall now be clean done away from 'em; which ſeems to me to be the meaning of our <hi>Original Sin being waſh'd away by the Waters of Baptiſm;</hi> It imports, that the Covenant which made Original Sin imputable to us, is now <hi>Cancell'd,</hi> and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning force of it took away by our being admitted into another more Merciful and Gracious Covenant. And this, I ſay, is a very great Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to Infants; ſo that we may be ſure of their Salvation, whenever they dye in their Infancy, having all the Forgiving Mercies purchas'd by Chriſt, and held forth to them in the Covenant of Grace, enſtated on them. And indeed, if the thing were diſputable, whether there were any ſuch thing as the Original Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> imputed to his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity; however, I ſhould be very careful to have my Infant as early Baptized as poſſible. It is at leaſtwiſe the ſurer ſide to be actually in a Covenant of Grace and Mercy, than to remain under one, where there may be the leaſt probability of incurring Danger by being in it. One cannot make too ſure of a ſtate of Salvation. So that the being early Baptized into ſuch a ſtate, is to be accounted a very great Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, were it only on the account of thoſe mighty Priviledges it inſtates upon 'em, and inſures unto 'em.</p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Nor is it leſs a Happineſs to thoſe Infants that have been Baptiz'd, <hi>That they have thereby been ſo early engag'd in the Service of God.</hi> It is happy for 'em, that God has had the firſt Poſſeſſion of 'em. It will be like to prove a means of keeping out the Devil from getting any Intereſt in 'em. They have been hereby already prein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd, and dedicated to the Service of their good God; and it is to be hop'd their Parents and Sureties (or it will be infinitely their fault) will be continually minding 'em of it, as they grow up, and will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtil by degrees into their Hearts, an underſtanding and ſenſe of the Terms and Articles of their Covenant with God; watching withal, that they ſwerve not away from their ſolemn Vows and Promiſes made unto him. And beſides, by this early Dedication of Perſons, whilſt Infants, unto God, it is provided (which alone is a great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to them, and the Church of Chriſt) that ſo many ſhall not ſtand off ſo long out of the Pale of the Church, by not entring into it through the Door of Baptiſm; that ſo many ſhall not ſtand out, I ſay, through ſome unreaſonable Fear or Scrupuloſity, leſt if they Sin after Baptiſm, it would be worſe for 'em; even as many as do now abſent themſelves, upon ſome ſuch pretences, from the Lord's-Supper, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps all the days of their Lives. Many Thouſands of theſe, who are now happily within the Pale of the Church, and Covenant of Grace by Baptiſm, if they were not to be took into it till grown up to Years of Diſcretion, 'tis much to be fear'd, leaſt by reaſon of ſome Miſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions or Deluſions of Satan, or Love to their Luſts (which every Man naturally has) they would defer it too long, till the approach of Death perhaps, before they'd put themſelves into a ſtate of Salvation, as ſome miſperſwaded Perſons did in the Primitive Times, to the very great Scandal of the Church, and the infinite prejudice of their own Souls, when many times they were ſnatcht away by Death before
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:151517:238"/> they could put themſelves out of the State of Infidels. But this Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to the Church of Chriſt, and danger to their own Souls is happily prevented by Perſons being Baptized into it in their Infancy. So that, I ſay, it is a very great Happineſs to thoſe Infants that have been Baptized on this account alſo, that they have been ſo early en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in the Service of God.</p>
                  <p>And now, I hope, what has been hitherto ſaid, may be ſufficient to Juſtifie your having been Baptized into the Covenant of Grace in the time of your Infancy. Each of theſe Arguments I have made uſe of to this purpoſe, I do take to have ſufficient force of themſelves to prove the Point; but I have endeavour'd ſo to range 'em one with another, that beſides that Native Strength there may be in each of 'em in particular, like the Parts of a well-compacted Building, they ſhould be the ſtronger for being joyn'd together. And tho' indeed it may require your more cloſe Attention to carry the whole Train of Arguments along in your Minds, than to apprehend one ſingle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by it ſelf, yet the Conviction, I am ſure, would be the ſtronger, if you will take 'em all, as I have laid 'em together.</p>

                     <hi>THE XXXI Lecture.</hi> VVhat did your Godfathers and Godmothers then for you? They did promiſe and vow three things in my Name.</head>
                  <p>IN commenting upon theſe Words, <hi>In my Baptiſm wherein I was made,</hi> I have already conſider'd one material Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, relating to the Entrance into the Covenant of Grace; <hi>viz. the Time when</hi> you were initiated therein; and I have juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied your having been baptized into it, even in the Age of Infancy. And now I come to the like Conſideration, and Vindication of a</p>
                  <p>Second Circumſtance relating to the ſame Matter, and requiſite alſo to be conſider'd by you; <hi>viz.</hi> whom as your Proxies and Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (conſidering it was at an Age you could not perſonally do it your ſelves) did preſent you to Baptiſm, and undertake for you this Bleſſed Covenant. And it was <hi>your Godfathers and Godmothers, who did promiſe and vow three things in your Name:</hi> For the more full Explication, and Juſtification of which Uſe of Godfathers and Godmothers, I will enquire,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Into the Meaning and Importance of the Words, <hi>Godfathers and Godmothers.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. I will ſhew what reaſon the Church had to appoint Godfathers and Godmothers, both to repreſent, and to engage for the Infant in Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. And laſtly, for the farther Juſtification of the thing out of Scripture, I will prove from thence, as a Power and Authority given
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:151517:239"/> by Chriſt to the Governours of the Church, to appoint ſuch reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Circumſtances, as they ſhall think fit, for the better Order and Decency of Divine Adminiſtrations, and the better Edification of the Souls of Men; ſo that their appointing of <hi>Godfathers</hi> and <hi>Godmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> was a moſt excellent and uſeful Inſtitution to this purpoſe. And,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Let us enquire into the Meaning and Importance of the Words,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the Terms Godfathers, and Godmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> 
                     <hi>Godfathers and Godmothers.</hi> And in the Ancient Writers of the Church, we find the Title of <hi>Sponſores,</hi> or <hi>Sureties,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tertul. de Bap. Auguſt. Tom. 2. 35. d. 2.</note> given 'em, which imports them to be Perſons that have given Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to God and the Church, about ſome Matter relating to the Infants they have preſented to Baptiſm. As alſo they are called <hi>Fide Juſſores;</hi> which is a Word of the like Importance, and ſignifies a Surety, or Bondſman. In the latter Ages, particularly amongſt the Reformed Churches, where they are generally in Uſe (and even <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius, Calviniſt</hi> Writers, do derive them from <hi>Iſ.</hi> 8.6.) they came to be called <hi>Compatres,</hi> and <hi>Commatres;</hi> which give me leave to tranſlate <hi>Joint-fathers,</hi> and <hi>Joint-mothers,</hi> with reſpect to their Spiritual Birth and State; which ſeems farther to import, that the Security they give to the Church, with reference to thoſe Children they preſent to Baptiſm, is concerning ſomething that belongs to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Parents to take care of, the Words ſignifying 'em to be join'd with 'em in the Parental Care. And laſtly, amongſt us they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly enough ſtiled <hi>Godfathers</hi> and <hi>Godmothers,</hi> becauſe this Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Security given by 'em, in behalf of the Infants, is given to God, and his Church, and is a Security given by theſe Perſons, ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Godfathers</hi> and <hi>Godmothers,</hi> that they will be inſtrumental to their New Birth, as their Parents were to their Natural. And let this ſuffice, as to the Importance of the Words; all which put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, do ſignifie thus much, that <hi>Godfathers,</hi> and <hi>Godmothers,</hi> are a Collateral Security join'd together with the Natural Parents, in the behalf of their Children entred into Covenant with God; and that this their Security is given to God, and his Church, that they will be Inſtruments in begetting them to God.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. And now let us enquire into the Nature of their <hi>Office,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>II.</hi> The Nature of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</note> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd in theſe Words, <hi>They did promiſe and vow three things in my Name.</hi> And truly the Nature of their Office ſeems to me to be no more, nor leſs than this; 1. An expreſs Engagement given to Chriſt, and his Church, in behalf of thoſe Infants they preſent to Baptiſm, that ſo ſoon as they become capable to be taught, they ſhall be inſtructed in the Nature of that Covenant, which they their Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have undertook for them; and, 2. That they ſhall be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, and advis'd by them to lead their Lives according to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations laid upon them by that their Covenant: And laſtly, That thoſe Infants ſhall moreover, after ſufficient Inſtruction in their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, ſolemnly take upon themſelves the Profeſſion of it, before the Chief Miniſter of Chriſt's Church, the Biſhop. I ſay that the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of <hi>Godfathers</hi> and <hi>Godmothers,</hi> does ſeem to me to import no more, nor leſs, than a Security given to God and his Church, that the baptized Perſon ſhall do thus, ſhall be inſtructed in his Covenant,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:151517:240"/> ſhall be minded to live according to it, and ſhall ſolemnly declare it, that it is his ſincere Intentions ſo to do. And,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is not only as a Proxy to ſpeak for the Child in Baptiſm.</note>Firſt, that he ſhall be inſtructed in his Covenant. True it is, theſe Words, <hi>They did promiſe, and vow three things in my Name</hi> do ſeem to import ſomething more; as if the Sureties in Baptiſm did not only engage for the Inſtruction of the Party in the Nature of his Covenant, but for his actual performance of it too; which as it lays a very great and weighty Charge upon Sureties, too much it is thought for any one to undertake for another; ſo I am not willing to interpret them in a ſenſe, as will be apt to deterr conſcientious People from doing ſo charitable an Office; and make others have no Care about it, as a Bond they deſpair of ever diſcharging. I am not therefore inclin'd to expound them in ſo diſcouraging a ſenſe, if the Expreſſions will fairly bear milder, as I humbly conceive theſe will: For to <hi>do a thing in ones name</hi> (eſpecially in the tranſacting of Covenants, where Privileges and Advantages accrue thereby) is to act as a Proxy in the others ſtead. In the acting as ſuch, in any Covenant, by reaſon of the Abſence, or Minority, or other Incapacity of the Perſon main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned, it is very uſual for the Proxy, ſo to perſonate the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting Party himſelf, as if he were the Perſon whom he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents. And thus theſe Words, <hi>They did promiſe and vow three things in my Namr,</hi> ſhall be underſtood to mean no more than this; that I being uncapable my ſelf, by reaſon of my Infancy, to expreſs my Conſent to my Part of the Covenant, my <hi>Godfathers</hi> and <hi>Godmothers</hi> were my Mouth, who did it for me. Now this I do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed take to be part of the Senſe, but not the whole Importance; for then there would be no Engagement to any thing on the <hi>Godfathers and Godmothers</hi> part, whereas they are ſomething more than meer Proxies, and are really, and truly Sureties for ſomething to be done, tho' not perhaps that the Perſon baptized ſhall actually perform his Covenant; yet, at leaſt, that he ſhall be inſtructed in the Nature of it, ſo as to know what he ought to perform.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">But it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports withal a Security given to God, and his Church, that the Child ſhall be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſmal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note>And this taking care of the Child's Inſtruction, is the firſt part of the Duty of Godfathers and Godmothers: For the beſt way, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, to underſtand the meaning of any Author in Words more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally expreſt, is to conſult thoſe Expoſitions and Explications he makes of his own Senſe elſewhere, if any ſuch can be met withal. And now we have a moſt excellent Key for the opening of this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of the Godfathers and Godmothers, in the behalf of the Child baptized, in the Exhortation given them after Baptiſm, and in the Charge to bring the Baptized Perſon to <hi>Confirmation.</hi> The Words of the Exhortation run thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Foraſmuch as this Child hath promiſed by you that are his Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to renounce the Devil, and all his Works, to believe in God, and to ſerve him; Ye muſt remember, that it is your Parts and Duty to ſee that this Infant be taught, ſo ſoon as he ſhall be able to learn, what a ſolemn Vow, Promiſe, and Profeſſion he hath here made by you. And that he may know theſe things the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ye ſhall call upon him to hear Sermons; and chiefly ye ſhall provide, that he may learn the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments in the Vulgar Tongue, and all other things,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:151517:240"/> which a Chriſtian ought to know, and believe to his Soul's Health; And that this Child may be vertuoſly brought up to lead a Godly and a Chriſtian Life, remembring always that Baptiſm doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto us our Profeſſion, which is to follow the Example of our Saviour Chriſt, and to be made like unto him; that as he dyed, and roſe again for us, ſo ſhould we, who are Baptized, <hi>dye to Sin, and riſe again unto Righteouſneſs,</hi> continually mortifying all our evil and corrupt Affections, and daily proceeding in all Vertue, and Godlineſs of Living.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that hereby it does appear, that the Engagement of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers and Godmothers is in the firſt place, that they will take care to have thoſe Infants, whom they have preſented to Baptiſm, Catechiſed in the Nature of that Covenant they have in the way of Proxy for them, enter'd into; which is the Importance of theſe Words: <q>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that it is your Parts and Duties, to ſee that this Infant be taught ſo ſoon as he ſhall learn, what a ſolemn Vow, Promiſe, and Profeſſion he hath here made by you, <hi>which is the proper Work of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſing to teach 'em.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are alſo, for their farther Edification in this grand Matter of their Covenant, to call upon 'em to <hi>hear Sermons,</hi> which are a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Inſtruction deſign'd to improve 'em in all that neceſſary Knowledge, the beginnings of which was laid by Catechiſing. But eſpecially their Care muſt be to have 'em throughly Catechiſed, which lays the Foundation of Divine Knowledge in the Principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, without which there can be no bottom for their Edification any other way; <hi>Chiefly,</hi> ſays the Exhortation, <hi>ye ſhall provide that they may learn the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Vulgar Tongue, and all other things which a Chriſtian ought to know, and believe to his Soul's Health,</hi> which I ſay, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per work of Catechiſing to teach 'em.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is the Office of theſe Sureties to admoniſh the Child to live according to his Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> Having thus took care to have 'em well inſtructed by Catechiſing and Preaching, in the Articles and Conditions of their Covenant, their next Care muſt be to admoniſh and adviſe 'em, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to apply themſelves to live according to thoſe Obligations laid upon 'em in their Covenant with God. Youth, of all Perſons, want good Monitors, as being of themſelves giddy, and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and too regardleſs of what does mainly concern 'em; and their Sureties ought to make it a part of their Care, peculiarly to admoniſh ſuch as they have a band in bringing into the Covenant, that they live according to it; ſo it follows in that moſt Excellent Exhortation, <hi>Ye ſhall take care that this Child may be vertuoulſy brought up, to lead a Godly and a Chriſtian Life,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, And then as for the laſt thing,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And to take care that at Years of Diſcretion, the Child ſhould take his Vow upon himſelf before the Biſhop in Confirmation.</note> wherein I ſaid conſiſts the Office of Sureties in Baptiſm; <hi>viz.</hi> that they take care their Youth after all due Inſtruction in the Nature of the Covenant, ſhould perſonally, for their own parts, take it upon themſelves before the Chief Miniſter of Chriſt, the Biſhop: This you have deliver'd plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully in the Charge given about <hi>Confirmation,</hi> running in theſe Words, <hi>Ye are to take care that this Child be brought to the Biſhop to be confirmed by him, ſo ſoon as he can ſay the Creed,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:151517:241"/> the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments, in the Vulgar Tongue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that if you will allow the Bleſſed Authors of our moſt Divine and Excellent Liturgy, the Liberty to explain themſelves: The utmoſt Importance of theſe Words, <hi>They did promiſe and vow three things in my Name,</hi> is, 1. an Engagement to Chriſt, and his Church, in the behalf of the Baptized Infant, that ſo ſoon as he becomes capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he ſhall be inſtructed in his Covenant; 2. that he ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh'd to live according to it; and 3. that he ſhall ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his ſincere Intentions ſo to do.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>III.</hi> The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Church has to require Sureties.</note>III. And now let us ſee what reaſon the Church had to appoint Godfathers and Godmothers, not only to repreſent, but thus to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage for the Infant in Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">It is for the better Order and Decency of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, that ſome ſhould be the Mouth of the Child.</note>And truly, as to the repreſenting part, there ſeems to me to be as great reaſon for that, as that all things in Divine Adminiſtrations ſhould be done <hi>decently, and in order,</hi> as the Apoſtle commands, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. For why? You are not again to be told, that this whole Solemnity of Baptiſm is the tranſacting of a Covenant with God; a Covenant, wherein both Parties concerned are either perſonally themſelves, or by others, as their Proxies, to make mutual Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments one to another, to perform each his Part of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
                  <p>Now God, who is the firſt and prime Party in this Covenant: He, true it is, is ſufficient for theſe things of himſelf, and needs no other to engage for him; yet in Compaſſion to our Infirmities, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear the Majeſty of God's Preſence (hence the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> after the Thunder and Lightning on Mount <hi>Sinai, prayed he would ſpeak to them by his Servant Moſes, lest they ſhould dye</hi>) Tho' God need not, I ſay, to treat with us by Proxy; yet, in conformity to our Weakneſs he hath ſubſtituted the Prieſt in his ſtead, to aſſure us of the Promiſes, his part of the Covenant. And what then ſhall the Infant do, who is ſo far uncapable of tranſacting perſonally the Covenant, and engaging by himſelf to perform its Conditions, that he does not, nor cannot underſtand the Conditions of it? what I ſay ſhall he do? Why it is fit, that he likewiſe by his Sureties, as by Proxy, ſhould engage that he will do his part. To this purpoſe, ſaith a Father; <q>ſince for want of Age Children cannot believe with the Heart to Righteouſneſs, nor confeſs with the Mouth unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, therefore others anſwer for 'em, that the Sacrament may be admitted compleatly to 'em.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It would indeed ſeem to me a very odd, and indecent, and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly thing (extremely unlike the uſual way of tranſacting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants) when one, and He ſo great a Party concern'd as God, ſhould vouchſafe to make over by his Proxy (the Miniſter of the Covenant) expreſs Aſſurances of Infinite Mercies; the other Party, a poor wretched Creature, in whoſe Favour this is done, ſhould not have a Mouth, either by himſelf or others, to make an open and ſolemn Proteſtation of Acceptance of thoſe Gracious Terms, and of ſincere Reſolutions to perform his part. A ſilence on his ſide, wou'd look like a ſullen, ungrateful refuſal of ſuch Gracious Overtures and Terms
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:151517:241"/> of Mercy, the moſt indecent and diſorderly thing in the World. The Adminiſtration would be extreamly indecent, without a Proxy to Repreſent the Infant.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, ſo much is the Honour of God, and of the Church,<note place="margin">It is of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to the Church, that Security be given, that every one who is admitted a Member into it, ſhould live to the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of it.</note> and of the Chriſtian Religion concern'd, that no Perſon be enter'd into the Profeſſion of the Goſpel, who will not live anſwerably to it, that it is highly fit, it is extreamly requiſite, all poſſible Security ſhou'd be firſt given to God and his Church, that the Perſon admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Society of Chriſtians, ſhould at leaſtwiſe be Inſtructed, and Admoniſh'd, and be Engag'd ſolemnly to profeſs what belongs to him to do, as a Member of that Body. So far it is requiſite Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity ſhould be given before he is admitted a Member of Chriſt's Church, if it be not farther neceſſary it ſhould be given, for his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving according to the Obligations of the Covenant. Indeed, ſo far is it from being unreaſonable to require Security, that he ſhould be Inſtructed and Admoniſh'd, what are his Obligations, that if we cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider the Matter, it may not ſeem ſo unreaſonable, as ſome do imagine, to exact Security of the Perſon Baptized, even that he ſhall live up to the Obligations laid upon him in his Covenant.</p>
                  <p>We ſee it daily practic'd,<note place="margin">This is what Societies, whoſe Honour and Intereſt is of infinite leſs conſequence, do daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</note> and it is allow'd a reaſonable and prudent Caution in all Societies of Men, to exact Security from thoſe who are not reſponſible themſelves, that they ſhall Anſwer the Ends and Intereſts of that Society, whereinto they deſire to be admitted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will take 'em in amongſt 'em. This is the common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice you know, in all <hi>Corporations</hi> and <hi>Companies.</hi> And even in our Pariſh concerns, no Man ſhall be admitted into either, from whom they apprehend any Danger, without giving Security againſt all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages that may accrue by his Admiſſion. And may not the Church of Chriſt, upon as good Grounds, require good Security from Children, who cannot Anſwer, nor Engage for themſelves; and who (conſidering the inbred Corruption of Nature) are in danger enough (without a great deal of Care) of proving very pernicious Members? Shall not She, I ſay, as well as other Societies, whoſe Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts are infinitely leſs, exact of all that are admitted into her Body, that they will never depart from, or contemn her Laws, nor Act contrary to the Honour and Intereſt of her, and her Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our? Is not the Church of Chriſt a Society, yea, the chief of all Societies? Are not her, and her great Maſters Honour and Intereſt, the moſt conſiderable of all others in the World? And does it not then infinitely concern her, that none of her Members turn Rebels to the Laws of God, that they do not become Profane and Wicked Livers, the greateſt Injury that can be done to God and her ſelf? I ſure, I think it does, for there is nothing tends more to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of her Saviour, and of Religion, and of her ſelf, than that any of her Members ſhould become Profane and Wicked. The III Lives of her Children make her a Sport to the vile Atheiſt, a Scorn and Reproach to <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Infidels.</hi> It extreamly hinders the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels prevailing upon Infidels abroad, and is hugely Offenſive to all her Pious Sons at home. Blame her not therefore for taking ſuch Prudent Care, as to admit none into her Society, without having firſt Security given of their good Behaviour.</p>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:151517:242"/>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">That of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient without Collateral Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</note>And indeed, ſo far is ſhe from deſerving Blame therein, that we are to reckon her moderate in her Demands, when ſhe requires no more than Security, that the New Member ſhall be well Principl'd, and Educated, and duly Admoniſh'd. Things that may be eaſily in our Power to take care of.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it ſufficient Security to the Church, that the Parents are bound to take this Care of their Children. The Natural Parents, it is confeſs'd, are oblig'd both by the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> and the expreſs Laws of God, <hi>to bring up their Children in the Nurture and Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the Lord;</hi> But this is not enough in ſo grand a Concern; Parents poſſibly may not live to Educate their Children, and how many of thoſe that do live, are wofully careleſs in the Principling of them, with a due Knowledge and Senſe of the Goodneſs of God to them, and thoſe great Duties they owe to him?

                     <note place="margin">The requiring of this as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable now as in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Times.</note>Nor is the giving ſuch Security for their Religious Education leſs neceſſary now, than it was in the Primitive Times. It is well known, that then all Infants had their <hi>Sponſors</hi> or <hi>Sureties</hi> that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd at the Font for their Chriſtian Education, and Faithfulneſs in their Covenant; And that for this, amongſt other Reaſons, leſt in thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting Times the Parents being took off by their Perſecutors, their Infants and Children ſhou'd remain expos'd to the danger of being Train'd up in <hi>Paganiſh</hi> Idolatry, for want of ſome Perſons particularly Engag'd to take care of 'em.</p>
                  <p>The Church, true it is, is not now ſo often ſhak'd with violent Perſecutions, as in thoſe Days: Tho' ſometimes it has its cruel Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, in the very Bowels of it, full as furious as ever were the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens in their bloody Slaughters, and as zealous to raviſh from the Orthodox their Children, to train 'em up in their wicked Idolatry. But however,<note place="margin">This Charge no unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Impoſition at any time, being little more than what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd from one Chriſtian to another in common Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at all times.</note> beſides this, it ought to be conſider'd, that our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God is not broke, only by <hi>Apoſtatizing</hi> back from the Service of the true God, to the Worſhip of the Devil, or Evil Spirits, but by living in Ungodlineſs and Worldly Luſts; and therefore that equal Care ought to be taken, as then that the Child ſhou'd <hi>Renounce the Devil and all his Works, and believe in God;</hi> ſo now that he ſhall <hi>Obey God's Holy Will and Commandments, and walk in the ſame all the Days of his Life;</hi> And God and his Church is as much Diſhonour'd, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:151517:242"/> take all poſſible Security againſt the one, as then it did againſt the other ſort of ſcandalous and dangerous Violations of its Covenant; eſpecially if it be farther conſidere'd, that Proſperity and Peace being infinitely more apt to corrupt the Lives and Manners of Men, than Sufferings are; Perſons are much more ſubject to fall into theſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olations of their Covenant, by ſinful Immoralities now, than by <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſh</hi> Apoſtacies they were then.</p>
                  <p>Nor, <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Is it at any time a hard and unreaſonable Impoſition upon the <hi>Godfathers,</hi> and <hi>Godmothers,</hi> to make 'em give Security for the Chriſtian Education of other Peoples Children. We are all of us to be helpful to one another, eſpecially to be aſſiſtant in thoſe things which concern the good of their Immortal Souls; and there is none but a cruel and murderous <hi>Cain</hi> would have ſaid, <hi>Am I my Brothers Keeper.</hi> And if the utmoſt that the Sureties do Promiſe and Vow in behalf of the Infant, does extend to no more than this, to ſee that he ſhall be Train'd up in the Principles of Religion; and Admoniſh'd to live up according to what he has ſolemnly Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted; and openly and ſolemnly to confirm this his Covenant, when he comes to an Age of Underſtanding; and this only upon the natural Parents neglect: Why, this truly 'tis confeſt, will coſt ſome Pains, and perhaps too ſome ſmall Charge; but then let ſuch a one conſider, he has an opportunity put into his Hands to ſave a Soul, and let him withal conſider, what the Apoſtle ſays for his Encouragement therein, <hi>James</hi> 5.20. that <hi>He which ſhall ſave a Soul from Death ſhall cover a multitude of Sins.</hi> So that thus you ſee what reaſon the Church had to appoint <hi>Godfathers</hi> and <hi>Godmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> not only to <hi>repreſent</hi> the Infant, but to <hi>engage</hi> for it in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.

                  <p>I ſay, <hi>beſides the reaſon of the thing,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">It is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any Eccleſiaſtic Inſtitution, that it be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, tho' not ſupported by any expreſs Scripture.</note> It is a very unhappy Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice which ſome do labour under, that the beſt <hi>reaſon</hi> is no proof with them, without ſome expreſs Scriptures to command that very Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, tho' it be not a Matter above Reaſon, but left by Scripture to the Determination of it.</p>
                  <p>Now, to come to a right Underſtanding of this Matter, we muſt diſtinguiſh upon ſuch Points as are not, and ſuch as are to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd by meer Reaſon. And,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There are ſome great Points of Faith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>1.</hi> The ſole Authority whereon to ground the Belief of the Myſteries of Religion, muſt be Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</note> ſuch as the <hi>Myſtery of the Trinity,</hi> of the <hi>Incarnation, Mediation,</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction of Chriſt,</hi> above the reach of Human Reaſon to have found out; and now, that they are Reveal'd beyond the compaſs of it fully to comprehend; which Articles we call the <hi>Myſteries of Chriſtianity.</hi> And theſe we are bound to Believe, according as they are Reveal'd to us, without <hi>adding to,</hi> or <hi>taking from 'em,</hi> being fully aſſur'd, that the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that Word of God, which does Reveal theſe Truths to us, is it ſelf moſt Infallibly true, as being the Teſtimony of him who is Infinite Wiſdom, and cannot be deceiv'd himſelf; and is Infinite Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and will not, cannot deceive others. And therefore with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to theſe Sacred Truths, it is the part of every Chriſtian to <hi>Caſt down Imaginations,</hi> or Reaſonings, <hi>and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt ithe knowledge of God, bringing into Captivity every Thought to the Obedience of Christ:</hi> 2 Cor 10.5. Not but that Reaſon has its Uſe here in Judging of the ſufficiency of thoſe Proofs from Scripture, which are produc'd to eſtabliſh the Truth of any Article of Faith. But as it is beyond the Power of meer Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to have diſcover'd God's Methods of ſaving us by Chriſt, and the like; ſo it wou'd be the higheſt Preſumption to oppoſe our narrow ſcantling of Reaſon to God's Wiſdom in his Diſpenſations towards us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the next place, there are other Points in Religion,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>2.</hi> Both Faith and Practice, as to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion, and Moral Duties, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded both upon the Word of God and right Reaſon.</note> as well <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> as <hi>Moral Duties,</hi> to regulate both our Belief and Practice, in reference to which, we are left to Scripture and Reaſon conjunctly, with this difference; that we muſt have our Eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Scripture, as the only perfect Rule, ſuch are the Articles of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion, as the <hi>Belief of God, of a Providence, of the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the Soul, and of Rewards and Puniſhments in another World.</hi> And all, or moſt of the <hi>Duties of Morality</hi> alſo, have the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or our own Reaſon, both directing and enforcing the Practice of 'em. Only our Natural Reaſon in this our Corrupted State, being a Candle that burns very dimm: We muſt, I ſay, have our Eye
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:151517:244"/> principally upon the Light of Scripture, which is the ſingular Gift of God, given to Conduct us ſafe through the Intricate Mazes and Difficulties of this World, to another, and that a better; to be a <hi>Light unto our Feet, and a Lanthorn unto our Path,</hi> that our Footſteps may not ſlide, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.105. And a moſt perfect Rule the <hi>Scripture</hi> is, <hi>It being given by Inſpiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs, that the Man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſh'd unto all Good Works,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16, 17.</p>
                  <p>But tho' Natural Reaſon, now in its Eclipſe by Sin, yields not Light enough of it ſelf, without the help of Divine Revelation, to guide us unto Happineſs; yet ſo far as it can direct us, and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Scripture Light, we are to follow its Guidance; It is as well the Gift of God as the other, and was given us to the ſame Ends and Purpoſes; and we are therefore to bleſs God for ſo excellent a Gift as our Reaſon, and muſt follow its Dictates, without going con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Reaſon within us, in whatſoever it does preſcribe us that is not contradicted by the Word of God; for where the Word of God does not thwart, our own Reaſon in that Caſe, is left by God in its Original Authority, which it had before Divine Revelation, and we are to look upon it as the Divine Will and Pleaſure, that we ſhould act what ſeems but reaſonable.</p>
                  <p>And hence we find that our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, do often appeal to our own Reaſon as a Guide we ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Thus <hi>Luke</hi> 12.57. <hi>Yea, and why even of your ſelves judge you not what is right,</hi> ſays he to the Phariſees. And indeed in one of the moſt important Caſes that was ever put to any deciſion, the Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> do appeal to Men's own Reaſon to determine 'em what they ſhou'd do. The <hi>Rulers of the Jews call'd them, and commanded them not to ſpeak at all, nor to teach in the Name of Jeſus; but Peter and John anſwer'd, and ſaid unto them, Whether it be right in the ſight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye,</hi> Acts 4.18, 19. The Apoſtles did not here call in the Authority of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to juſtifie them in what they did, but did appeal to their own Reaſon. And the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. the Apoſtle undertaking to convince them how ill a thing it was for 'em to partake of things offer'd to Idols; how does he go about to do it? Why, ſays he, <hi>I ſpeak unto wiſe Men, judge ye what I ſay, Verſe</hi> 15. and ſo goes on by many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, fetch'd from the Nature and Reaſon of Sacrifices and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to prove that Men ought not to <hi>partake</hi> of two ſuch different ones, as the <hi>Table of God, and the Table of Devils, Verſe</hi> 21.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>3.</hi> Religious Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies left to the Reaſon and Diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Church-Governours to appoint.</note>3. There are beſides theſe neceſſary and eſſential Parts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, others but Appendages, or certain Modes and Circumſtances retaining to it; ſuch are thoſe Ceremonies appointed by Authority for the greater Solemnity of Divine Adminiſtrations. And the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining what theſe are to be, is plainly permitted to the Reaſon and Diſcretion of the Governors of the Church, as may be fairly concluded from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13, 14, 18. where the Apoſtle makes Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the ſole Judge that muſt be ſubmitted to in point of <hi>Decency and Order.</hi> The Caſe before the Apoſtle, was, <hi>whether Women ought to appear veiled in the Church;</hi> and how does he prove it; why from
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:151517:244"/> Reaſon, and the Cuſtom of the Churches; and he ſeverely twits thoſe as perverſe Perſons, that in ſuch Caſes will not be govern'd by ſuch Arguments: <hi>Judge in your ſelves, is it comely that a Woman pray with her Head uncover'd, doth not even Nature,</hi> that is Cuſtom, <hi>it ſelf teach you? But if any Man be contentious, we have no ſuch Cuſtom, nor the Churches of God;</hi> that is, if People will be ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, I think it ſufficient to tell them, as that which ought to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern 'em, the Nature and Reaſon of the thing, and the Cuſtom of the Church is againſt 'em. So that <hi>Reaſon</hi> you ſee is not excluded from judging what is fit, and proper to be done in point of Decency and Order, and for the greater Solemnity of Divine Adminiſtrations: And therefore having ſhew'd you what Reaſon the Church had to appoint <hi>Godfathers and Godmothers,</hi> not only as Proxies to repreſent the Infant, but as Sureties to engage for it in Baptiſm, I need not much to inſiſt on other Arguments in juſtification of that Uſage of the Church. But however that no Scruple may remain, if poſſible, in any honeſt Mind, that will be convinc'd, for a farther juſtification of the Lawfulneſs and Expedience of 'em:</p>
                  <p n="1">I. I will prove out of Scripture,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>I.</hi> That Chriſt gave Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of the Church to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute ſuch <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſages, as ſhall be for Decency and Order, and the better Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Souls of Men, prov'd from Scripture.</note> that there has been a Power and Authority given by Chriſt to the Governors of the Church, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point ſuch reaſonable Circumſtances as they ſhall think fit, for the greater <hi>Order and Decency</hi> of Divine Adminiſtrations, and the <hi>better Edification</hi> of the Souls of Men. And then,</p>
                  <p n="2">II. I will ſhew you, that their appointing of <hi>Godfathers</hi> and <hi>Godmothers,</hi> was a moſt excellent and uſeful Inſtitution to this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>And Firſt, I will prove out of Scripture, that there has been a Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It were a thing very well worth the Conſideration of all Perſons, what Obſervance our Bleſſed Saviour paid to thoſe <hi>Circumſtantial</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments relating to Divine Worſhip, which the Governors of the Jewiſh Church (without any farther Authority from Scripture, than the general Commiſſion and Power it gives Governors to exerciſe) had of their own ſelves order'd. There was as little need one would have thought in that Church, as any,<note place="margin">This allow'd to the Governors of the Jewiſh Church.</note> for its Governors to appoint any new <hi>Modes</hi> or <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of Worſhip, God himſelf having given 'em ſuch very particular Orders relating to Divine Service. But as little need as there ſeem'd to be of 'em, they however took upon 'em to appoint many things, beſides what God himſelf had ordain'd. And yet Chriſt did not only conform to 'em in his own Practice, as appears from his celebrating the <hi>Feaſt of Dedication, John</hi> 10.22, 23. which was a Feſtival of mere humane Inſtitution, in memory of their Deliverance from the Tyranny of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> and the purging of the Temple, and the Altar from his Idolatry; but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he commanded his Followers to do ſo too, ſo long as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued under the Jewiſh Diſpenſation.</p>
                  <p>From the ſeveral Inſtances that are given by <hi>Thorndicke, Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, Lightfoot,</hi> and others skilful in Jewiſh Learning, they were <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſcriptural Rites,</hi> and meer <hi>Humane Inventions,</hi> all thoſe many Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:151517:245"/> that the Jews had introduced into their Worſhip in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's time: But notwithſtanding that, the Bleſſed Jeſus did not only himſelf conform to the Cuſtom of the Church in the Uſe of 'em, but commanded likewiſe others to be obedient likewiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to thoſe <hi>who ſat in Moſes's Chair;</hi> whoſe Conſtitutions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would have to be <hi>obſerv'd,</hi> as you may ſee, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.2, 3. <hi>Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Scribes and Phariſees</hi> (that is, thoſe of 'em who made up the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> the higheſt Juriſdiction in Church-Matters amongſt the Jews) <hi>ſit in Moſes's Seat; and therefore whatſoever they bid you obſerve, that obſerve and do.</hi> They had given him but little reaſon to favour their Authority, as you may ſee in the Chapter immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before: They came to inſnare him with their Queſtions, and to trepan him into ſome miſchievous Inconvenience if they could; but however, no ſooner was he quit of their troubleſome Company, but he takes care to advertiſe his Diſciples, that ſuch of 'em who were of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> were to be looked on by them as their lawful Rulers, that had Authority over them, ſucceeding <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Seventy, Numb.</hi> 11.16. as our Biſhops and Church: Governours, now do Chriſt and his Apoſtles; and therefore he bids 'em to conform themſelves to all their lawful Commands, in all regular Subjection and Obedience; which is a manifeſt proof, what Obſervance our Saviour would have to be paid to the Governors of the Church in all their <hi>Conſtitutions,</hi> that, relating to the Worſhip of God, do not thwart the Divine Commands.</p>
                  <p>True it is, our Bleſſed Lord did in another Place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.3. reprimand the Phariſees for their Superſtitious Obſervance of their Traditions, <hi>and for teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men, Verſe</hi> 9. But then it ought to be well conſidered, what ſort of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and Doctrines they were, whoſe Obſervance he reprov'd 'em for. And what were they, but ſuch, in whoſe Obſervance they did plainly violate God's expreſs Commands, or at leaſt did undermine the force of his Laws thereby? As appears by the Inſtance he gives; which was this, of denying Maintenance to their Parents in neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, under pretence of having devoted their Subſtance before to God; by which Evaſion, he tells them, they made the Commandment of God, concerning Honour due to Parents, of none effect by their Traditions, <hi>Verſe</hi> 6. and tells them withal, <hi>that in vain they did worſhip him, teaching thus for Doctrines the Commandments of Men.</hi> Such Conſtitutions indeed, which did contradict, or evacuate and undermine the Laws of God, we ſee here he did reprove 'em for; but what is that to the forbidding thoſe, which do no ways tend to any ſuch thing, but to the greater Order and Decency of his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? As to ſuch his own Doctrine, of obſerving the Commands of thoſe <hi>who ſat in Moſes's Chair,</hi> and his own Practice in conforming to whatſoever they appointed of that Nature, does ſufficiently ſhew us, what Power he own'd then to be in the Governours of the Church, to appoint ſuch reaſonable Ceremonies and Circumſtances, as they ſhould think fit, for the greater Order and Decency of Divine Adminiſtrations,<note place="margin">The ſame Power conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd to thoſe elſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in the Chriſtian.</note> and for the better Edification of the Souls of Men.</p>
                  <p>Nor did He, or his Apoſtles, afterwards retrench the Governors of the Chriſtian Church of that Authority, which then he own'd to be

                  <p>How decent and orderly, and like to the tranſacting of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, it renders the adminiſtration of Baptiſm, I have already told you: But that it is very ſerviceable to the Edification of Perſons Baptized, I will farther declare unto you.

                  <p n="1">1. The Nature of their Office. And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The good Effects we often ſee of Perſons having had <hi>Godfathers</hi> and <hi>Godmothers,</hi> as Sureties for 'em in their Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Firſt, If we conſider the Nature of their Office.</note>And, <hi>Firſt,</hi> If we conſider the Nature of their Office, how can we but expect from 'em a great deal of good, as to Perſons Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? For by the Nature of their Office, are they not Perſons that are ſolemnly engag'd in the Preſence of God, and of the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation then Aſſembl'd, and this to God himſelf, that they will take a ſpecial and particular Care of that Perſon then enter'd by their Means into the Society of Chriſtians, that he ſhall be truly inform'd of the Nature of his Covenant, and what Obligations lye upon him to diſcharge thoſe Duties contain'd in it, and which are to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd on his Part, as he will expect to ſhare in thoſe unſpeakable good things promis'd on God's part? And is not ſuch a ſolemn En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to God, made by the Sureties in ſuch a Preſence, and in ſuch a Place, and before ſuch a number of Witneſſes, likely to make Men careful to be as good as their Promiſe? And this if they ſhall be, and ſhall accordingly take care (if there be any occaſion for it by the Parents neglect) to have the Child Catechis'd and Inſtructed
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:151517:246"/> in the Chriſtian Religion, and ſhall Reprove him for his Miſcarriages, and Exhort him to a circumſpect walking with God, and never leave off till they have brought him at Years of Underſtanding before the chief Miniſter of Chriſt's Church, the Biſhop, there ſolemnly and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to profeſs in his own Perſon, that he will do ſo and ſo, as they have engag'd in his Name: If this they ſhall do, is not this the likelieſt way in the World to train up a Child in the Knowledge, and Love, and Fear of God, in which conſiſts his Edification.</p>
                  <p>Why, the thing I ſuppoſe would be readily granted, that the Office being conſider'd in it ſelf, the Inſtitution of <hi>Godmothers</hi> and <hi>Godmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> might be very uſeful to Peoples Edification, if <hi>Sureties</hi> would but take a due Care (if there ſhould be occaſion) of the Chriſtian Edification and Converſation of ſuch whom they have Engag'd for. We only want to ſee the good Effects of ſuch their Undertaking, which (God knows ſay ſome) are but ſmall; for who is it, ſay they, do we ſee take any care of any ſuch thing? This is what is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urg'd againſt this Inſtitution, by thoſe who are not well-affected to this, nor any other Conſtitution of our Church; and as weak as this Exception is, many think it a ſufficient Plea againſt having <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers</hi> and <hi>Godmothers</hi> in Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>But I would deſire ſuch Perſons to conſider, that if the Abuſe of any Ordinance, by Perſons that are Profane and Careleſs, were a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Reaſon againſt it, we muſt e'en aboliſh the Sacraments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for how many are there who come unprepared, and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily partake of 'em, not regarding what Obligations they have laid upon themſelves in the uſe of 'em, to be good Livers ever afterward; and the very Goſpel it ſelf, tho' a <hi>Savour of Life unto Life,</hi> unto ſome few, who live according to its Rules, is a <hi>Savour of Death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death,</hi> unto thoſe (and they are the greateſt number) unto whom it is Preach'd, and yet lead Lewd and Profligate Lives. But this is by Accident, and through Mens own Fault, that neither the Goſpel can perſwade, nor the Sacraments engage ſome Men to Obedience; and for that they muſt anſwer themſelves, and both the Goſpel and its Sacraments muſt notwithſtanding be continued in the Church, for the good they are capable of Working, and the good they actually do effect to ſome few. And ſo ought the Inſtitution of <hi>Godfathers</hi> and <hi>Godmothers.</hi> In its own Nature its an Office fitted to do good, and tho' many do not that good they ought, under that Character, yet on the ſcore of that good it may do, and thoſe good Effects we really ſee it ſometimes does do, it ought for that reaſon to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Church.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Which good Effects would be much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, were the choice of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers and Godmothers made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Canons of the Church.</note>And to the Edification of very many more, I am ſure this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance would contribute, if that choice were made of Perſons for <hi>Godfathers</hi> and <hi>Godmothers,</hi> which the Church preſcribes.

But then this is the Fault of Parents, not of the Church; and notwithſtanding this, the appointment of <hi>Godfathers</hi> and <hi>Godmothers,</hi> as Sureties in Baptiſm, ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd as a thing of a very uſeful Tendency, as to the more decent Adminiſtration of the Sacrament of Baptiſm, ſo to the better Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Perſon Baptized; to which purpoſe, according to the Power given 'em by Chriſt, the Governours of our Church have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>And thus, in Commenting upon the <hi>Preliminary Queſtions and Anſwers</hi> of the Catechiſm, I have at length gone through all thoſe Heads of Diſcourſe, I did at firſt propoſe to ſpeak to, in order to give you a full Underſtanding of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> that Covenant you enterd into with God in your Baptiſm. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. As to the Nature of this Covenant, I have, in the firſt place, explain'd to you the Terms and Conditions of it, both on Gods part, and on ours. In the ſecond place, I have laid before you the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Importance of this Covenant, ſhewing you how that it is a <hi>State of Salvation.</hi> Thirdly, I have accounted for the Original of it, and by whoſe Mediation you obtain'd ſuch Terms of Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, and <hi>that it was through Jeſus Christ our Lord.</hi> I have, Fourthly, acquainted you by whom, and how you have been <hi>Call'd</hi>
                     <pb n="343" facs="tcp:151517:248"/> to this State of Salvation, that it was <hi>Your Heavenly Father who hath called you to this State of Salvation, through Jeſus Christ our Lord.</hi> And, Laſtly, have Admoniſh'd you of the very great Reaſon you have to thank God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, for ſo exceeding great a Mercy, as his Calling you into it. So far I have let you into the Knowledge of the Nature of the Covenant of Grace. And,</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Having done this, I have declar'd to you by what Sacrament or Solemnity you enter'd into it.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. I have ſhew'd you the vaſt Obligations lying upon you faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to diſcharge your Covenant with God.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. I have directed you by what means you may perform it.</p>
                  <p>And, <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That nothing might be wanting fully to Inform you in all that pertains to the Doctrine of this Covenant, I have now Inform'd you in thoſe two Circumſtances relating to your entrance into it, the <hi>Time when,</hi> and the <hi>Perſons by whom</hi> you were Initiated therein.</p>
                  <p>Theſe laſt Points indeed, I thought once to have deferr'd the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon, till I ſhall come to the Laſt Part of the Catechiſm. But tho' the whole Doctrine of Divine Aſſiſtance and Prayer, may be treated upon when I ſhall come to the Lord's-Prayer, and the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion which leads to it; yet as they are the neceſſary Means of ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling us to perform our Covenant with God, they ought at leaſtwiſe to be generally conſider'd here. And even the Doctrine of <hi>Infant Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>uſe of Godfathers and Godmothers,</hi> tho' there is a Queſtion and Anſwer more direct upon both at the latter end of the Catechiſm, yet the poſitive handling of 'em is propereſt in this place; And whatever Objections can be rais'd againſt either, will moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally be handl'd upon theſe Words; <hi>Why then are Infants Baptized, when by reaſon of their tender Age they cannot perform them?</hi> The Anſwer to which is, <hi>Becauſe they Promiſe them both by their Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; which Promiſe when they come to Age themſelves are bound to perform.</hi> There is an Objection and Solution in theſe Words, and therefore they will be the fitteſt to found a Diſcourſe upon, conſiſting of the like. However, I think the general Doctrine of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace could not have been handl'd in all its Parts, without the conſideration of theſe latter Points; and that, I think, may be ſufficient to juſtifie us in treating upon 'em here, ſo as to give you a general View, as of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> ſo of all that pertains to the Doctrine of it.</p>
                  <p>And now what remains, but that you ſeriouſly reflect upon all that has been deliver'd upon this moſt important Subject of your <hi>Baptiſmal Covenant?</hi> I do call it ſuch, and I do think it ought to be the moſt ſtudied by you of any other. For why? Firſt, I take the Covenant of Grace, or our Baptiſmal Covenant, to compriſe the whole Doctrine of Chriſtianity, even all that, than which no Man
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:151517:249"/> as a meer Chriſtian is neceſſitated to know more, and than which the meaneſt ought not to know leſs. No Man in any Civil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract can perform his Bonds, without knowing the Conditions of the Obligations; no more can a Chriſtian be ſuppos'd to perform his Covenant with God, without knowing the Nature, Terms, and Conditions of it. Secondly, It is abſolutely neceſſary that all Youth ſhould comprehend the general Nature, Terms, and Conditions of their <hi>Baptiſmal Covenant,</hi> before they go to be <hi>Confirm'd.</hi> Thirdly, And all Perſons before they communicate in the Holy Sacrament, becauſe in both theſe Ordinances they <hi>ratifie</hi> their Baptiſmal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God. Fourthly, And if it be conſider'd, that all Perſons, in order to prepare for Death, muſt ſtrictly examine themſelves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Failures in all, and every the Terms and Conditions requir'd on their part in their Baptiſmal Covenant: And laſtly, that at the Day o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Judgment they will be juſtify'd, or condemn'd, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they have perform'd, or not perform'd their Covenant with God: All this conſider'd, I think you would be ſenſible that there is nothing more fundamentally neceſſary for every Chriſtian, eſpecially for Youth to be acquainted withal, than the Nature, Terms, and Conditions of their Baptiſmal Covenant.</p>
                  <p>It is indeed the General Terms and Conditions only, that you have been hitherto inſtructed in, by this Expoſition upon the <hi>Preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary Queſtions and Anſwers;</hi> and the more particular underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of 'em, is to be given you in my ſucceeding Diſcourſes upon the Creed and Decalogue. But the moſt uſeful Method of Inſtruction is to begin with Generals, and then to proceed to the Knowledge of Particulars. And that by both you may be render'd wiſe unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, may God Almighty grant of his infinite Mercy through Jeſus Chriſt his Son, to whom, and the Holy Spirit, Three Perſons and One God, be all Honour, and Glory, Might, Majeſty, and Dominion aſcribed both now, and for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <item>By the Kingdom of Heaven, is meant in Scripture, either firſt, the Kingdom of Grace in this Life, or ſecondly, the Kingdom of Glory, in the Life to come. The Kingdom of Grace, the Goſpel State. <hi>77</hi>

                        <item>The reaſon why the Goſpel State ſhould be dignify'd with the Title of the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe it ſo directly tends to render Men ſo exactly like the Bleſſed Saints, the Inhabitants of the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>78</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>This is not the meaning of the Kingdom of Heaven, here in the Catechiſm. Secondly, the Kingdom of Heaven ſignifies the Kingdom of Glory. This, a moſt noble and glorious State, as being dignify'd with ſo honourable and glorious a Title, as the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>79</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Hence all thoſe things in this World, wherein we conceive the higheſt Glory and Happineſs, are uſed, as Emblems, to ſet off our future Glory. All which things come ſhort of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing it. An Inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven, what? An Heir is one, who has a legal Right and Title to a Poſſeſſion made over to him. Such who have entred into the Covenant of Grace, are in like manner Heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven, as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are Heirs. <hi>80</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>It is through Chriſt alone, not owing to the Merit of our Obedience, that we are Intitled to the Inheritance of the Kingdom of Heaven. The vaſtneſs of a Chriſtian's Priviledge in being made an Inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven. First, it is in it ſelf a very great Priviledge to have the invaluable Poſſeſſions of Heaven, ſo ſetled and enſur'd, as to have a legal Claim and Title thereto, made over to one. <hi>81</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Secondly, if compar'd with what others enjoy, it is a ſingular Priviledge. The beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the moral Heathens could have but faint Hopes, built upon uncertain Conjectures of a future Happineſs. And their Hopes being faint, they could not in the strength
<pb facs="tcp:151517:252"/> thereof overcome great Temptations. But the Chriſtian's Hopes are ſure and ſtedfaſt, being founded upon the expreſs Promiſes and Covenant of the God of Truth. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch, there is no Temptation ſo alluring, nor Suffering ſo great, which he may not overcome. <hi>82</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>And whatever Certainty an honeſt Pagan might have, that God would reward his Vertue, yet depending only on the Uncovenanted Goodneſs of God, he could promiſe himſelf no greater a meaſure of Happineſs, than what his good Deeds did of themſelves deſerve, which muſt fall vaſtly ſhort of what is meant by the Kingdom of Heaven. But a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, to whom God has Covenanted, to make ſure a Crown of Glory, may, without Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, rely upon him, to make good the ſame. As Life and Immortality is brought to light through the Goſpel; ſo by Embracing it, and by coming into Covenant alone, Salvation can be expected. And to a ſincere Chriſtian, who is faithful in the Covenant, the Heavenly Inheritance is certain. <hi>83</hi>

                        <item>The Devil, and all his Works of Sin, muſt be abſolutely and entirely Renounced; becauſe, There is nothing but Evil proceeds from Satan.

But ſoon after, that Chriſt appeared in the World, did he moſt vigorouſly Exert his Malice againſt it. <hi>108</hi>

                        <item>So that for the firſt <hi>300</hi> Years we hear of nothing but of bloody Perſecutions. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of <hi>Rome</hi> the Inſtruments, but Satan the Inſtigator. And whereſoever any At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt is made to Convert a Country from Paganiſm, he does inſtigate the Princes and People thereof, to Perſecute and Deſtroy the Preachers of the Goſpel. And he is no leſs Induſtrious to drive Chriſtianity out of thoſe Countries, whereof it had once Poſſeſſion. And he has an Anti-Chriſtian Party within the Bowels of Chriſtendom, moſt ſadly weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſt's, and moſt effectually promoting the Intereſt of his own Kingdom. <hi>109</hi>
                        </item>

So far therefore as it engages our Affections too cloſely to it, ſo as to make us Inordinately, and Irregularly to mind it, and to neglect our great Concern, the Buſineſs of Religion, it is to be Renounced and Rejected by us. So long as we wear theſe Earthly Bodies about us, we are permitted the Uſe and Enjoyment of worldly Things, provided in Things lawful, and in Degrees allowable. But being our Souls, our principal Part, are ſoon to remove to Heaven, we muſt chiefly ſet our Affections on things Above, and mainly endeavour to attain 'em. <hi>144</hi>

                     <hi>THE XXVIII. Lecture.</hi> Rehearſe the Articles of thy Belief.</head>
                  <p>HAving heretofore Explain'd the General Nature of the Covenant of Grace, as it is taught in the Four firſt Queſtions and Anſwers of the Catechiſm, I come now to declare unto you in a more particular manner, the Terms and Conditions of the ſame Covenant: Of which Conditions this is one, That we <hi>Believe all the Articles of our Chriſtian Faith.</hi> What theſe Articles are, you are here commanded to <hi>Rehearſe,</hi> and to give an Account of them, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you are thereunto call'd. And to open the meaning thereof, there are Two Things requiſite to be made clear to you.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>What is meant by the Articles of our Belief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>What is the Importance of this Word Rehearſe:</hi> Rehearſe the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of thy Belief.<note place="margin">What meant by the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, Our Belief,</hi> we call that whole Collection and Sum of Chriſtian Doctrines and Truths, which has been ever accounted by the Church of Chriſt neceſſary to be believed by every Chriſtian in order to his Salvation. And the <hi>Articles of our Belief</hi> are every particular Truth contain'd in this general Summ, Collection, or Body of Chriſtian Doctrines.</p>
                  <p>This Abridgment and Summ,<note place="margin">The Creed wherefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled to the Apoſtles.</note> is generally call'd the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Creed.</hi> The Word <hi>Creed</hi> comes from the Latin Word <hi>Credo</hi> to Believe; and this is ſo called, becauſe it is a Body of Truths neceſſary to be Believed. It is call'd the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> either, 1ſt. becauſe it was compil'd by the Apoſtles themſelves: Or, 2dly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it contains the Subſtance of the Apoſtles Doctrine gathered into one Abridgment, which was diſperſedly delivered in their Writings.</p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:151517:260"/>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify'd by the Ancients to have been written by the Apoſtles.</note>And firſt, there wants not ſufficient Teſtimony from the Writings both of the Greek and Latin Fathers, that the Creed was compil'd by the Apoſtles themſelves. But it is not ſo proper, conſidering to whom I ſpeak, to inſiſt upon this kind of Teſtimony; the Proofs of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being to be brought from Authors, whoſe very Names are unknown to you. And indeed my whole Deſign in this Expoſition being to deliver to you the plaineſt Truths, and to give you for the ſame only Scriptural Proofs: I ſhall wave the firſt Reaſon of the Belief's being call'd the Apoſtles Creed, and ſhall proceed to the</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>2.</hi> Becauſe it contains the Subſtance of the Apoſtles Doctrine.</note>Second, which is this, That it is therefore ſo call'd, becauſe it contains the Subſtance of the Apoſtles Doctrine gathered into one ſhort Abridgment, which was diſperſedly delivered in their Writings, and which alone is enough to give it the Title of the <hi>Apostles Creed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Holy Scriptures and Writings of the Apoſtles, we have Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of divers kinds intermingled and interſperſed one amongſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Sometimes we meet with Matters of Faith propos'd as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be <hi>believ'd</hi> by us, and ſometimes Duties both to God and Man neceſſary to be <hi>practiſed.</hi> Sometimes we have Conſiderations ſerving as means to direct us, and ſometimes as motives to perſwade us to do our Duty. And this being ſo, it is not every Chriſtian that has ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leiſure or skill of himſelf to ſort theſe ſeveral kind of Doctrines aſunder, much leſs to diſtinguiſh between many Matters of Faith, which are Fundamental, and chiefly neceſſary to be believ'd, and other Points which are only wholſome Truths, but not of principal conſequence to be explicitly and expreſly aſſented to and confeſs'd.</p>
                  <p>And now as God himſelf for the Eaſe and Benefit of his Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, did collect the Summ of Religious Duties into <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> which contain the principal, and to which all Inferiour Duties may be reduc'd; And as our Bleſſed Saviour gave us a ſhort <hi>Form of Prayer</hi> containing all things fit for us to ask, or God to grant; ſo did the Apoſtles themſelves collect together into one A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment and Summ, all thoſe principal Points of Faith which are mainly neceſſary, and of greateſt conſequence to be believ'd, and upon all occaſions openly confeſs'd by every one that calls himſelf a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. And it was this Abridgment, or Summ, as is highly probable, and as the beſt Expoſitors do underſtand the Words, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle means by that <hi>Form of Doctrine that he delivered to the Romans,</hi> Ch. 6.17. and which was the <hi>Form of ſound Words</hi> that <hi>Timothy had heard of him,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The Reaſon of their making ſuch an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment.</note>And the reaſon of their making ſuch an Abridgment of our Faith, was no doubt to guard all true Believers againſt the Hereſies and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of ſeducing Teachers. Even in the very Times of the Apoſtles themſelves, did Satan and his Inſtruments begin to ſow the Tares of corrupt Doctrines in the Field or Church of Chriſt; and there could be no readier way to diſcover and diſtinguiſh their Peſtilent Errors, than for every Chriſtian to have a <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> collected out of the Holy Scriptures, ready at hand whereby to try thoſe other Doctrines: To which <hi>Form</hi> or Pattern of <hi>Sound Words,</hi> as it is called, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. if what they taught did not agree, it was eaſie for the moſt unletter'd Chriſtian to diſcover their Falſhood, which without a conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Skill and Knowledge in the Holy Writings, could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have been done.</p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:151517:260"/>
                  <p>And hence alſo it is, that the Creed is called <hi>Symbolum,</hi> in moſt Chriſtian Churches; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it is the Sign and <hi>Badge</hi> whereby to know a true and ſound Chriſtian, a <hi>Watch-word</hi> to diſtinguiſh him from falſe Hereticks that creep in clandeſtinely to beguile unwary Souls, and a <hi>Paſs-port</hi> in all Chriſtian Churches: For all theſe things does the Word <hi>Symbolum</hi> mean; and to all theſe Purpoſes was the Creed made uſe of in the Primitive Church. For did any Stranger come among 'em, they did immediately demand of him a Confeſſion of his Faith; which if he did deliver agreeable to this <hi>Form of ſound Words,</hi> they took it as a Sign of his being Orthodox, and not an Heretick; and it was a <hi>Paſsport</hi> to him, whereby he might either remain amongſt them, or have <hi>Letters Commendatory</hi> from 'em to go in the Peace of God to other Churches of the Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>And well may our Creed be accounted the ſureſt Teſt and Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of all Sound and Orthodox Doctrine, there being hardly any Hereſie and deadly Error that has heretofore, or ſhall hereafter ariſe in the Church, which it does not oppoſe or obviate: Nor any mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Truth of Chriſtian Religion, that concerns either <hi>God or Our ſelves,</hi> that it does not hold out to us as neceſſary to be believ'd; as will ſoon appear to you, if from this more general Account of it, we do but proceed more nearly to view the Excellent Frame and Method thereof, and the particular Articles of which it does conſiſt.</p>
                  <p>And this, I ſay, if we do, we ſhall ſee it does contain all the moſt material and weighty Truths that are neceſſary to be <hi>Believ'd</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning either <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man,</hi> and more we are not much concern'd to know.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Concerning God,<note place="margin">A Scheme of the whole Creed.</note> we are inſtructed in the Knowledge</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of his Being and Attributes, which we are taught in theſe Words, <hi>I Believe in God;</hi> for in the Notion of God are imply'd all thoſe High Perfections which we call the <hi>Divine Attributes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of the Three Perſons in the one Godhead, which we are taught to know and believe under theſe Three Names, <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. And we are inſtructed in thoſe Perſonal Works and Operations properly attributed to each Perſon in the Sacred Trinity: This in the following Expreſſions and Articles of the Creed. As to proceed in this General View and Diſſection of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>To God the Father</hi> does originally belong the <hi>Creation of the World,</hi> and the Exerciſe of a wiſe <hi>Providence</hi> over it; which we are taught to know and believe in theſe Words, <hi>Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>To God the Son</hi> does belong the <hi>Redemption</hi> of the World; that is, the reducing from the Power and Dominion of Sin and Satan, to the Obedience of the Father, that part of the World which had revolted from him, and ſo the Delivery and Salvation of it from cruel Slavery and woful Miſery. To accompliſh which Redemption, we are taught,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:151517:261"/>1. In general, That he was a Saviour; or one that both procur'd for us Salvation, and inſtructed us, by revealing the Goſpel, in the only Way and Method of attaining it. This in the Word <hi>Ieſus:</hi> And farther yet, in the Word <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to the end he might ſave us both from Sin and Satan; that as a <hi>Mediator</hi> betwixt God and Man he was inveſted with the threefold Office of <hi>Prophet, Priest,</hi> and <hi>King.</hi> And to enable him effectually to diſcharge this threefold Office, that he was himſelf both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> God, which is the Import of theſe Words, <hi>The only Begotten Son of God;</hi> an innocent and ſinleſs Man, the Import of theſe, <hi>He was Concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Holy Ghoſt, Born of the Virgin Mary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. In particular, we are inſtructed in each ſingle Act pertaining to theſe his <hi>Mediatorial Offices.</hi> And indeed it ſpeaks the excellent Structure of our Catechiſm, as I before obſerved, that it lets Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction gradually into the Souls of its Diſciples, by giving firſt a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral view of things, and by deſcending afterwards to inform the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Minds of young Beginners in the School of Chriſt, more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly and diſtinctly in each of thoſe Chriſtian Truths contain'd in the General Article. And this proportion is alſo obſervable in the Form of the Creed, where, as ſhort as is the <hi>Form of ſound Words,</hi> beſides the Doctrine of our Saviour's <hi>Mediation,</hi> and the Offices he underwent, more obſcurely coucht in the Words <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our more diſtinct Apprehenſion of what he has done for our Redemption from Sin and Satan, and for our Reconciliation with the Father, we have the Nature and Acts of thoſe ſeveral Offices particularly taught us in the following Articles of the Creed. Only,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to the Nature and Acts of his <hi>Prophetick Office,</hi> they are not indeed ſo expreſly and diſtinctly taught us as thoſe of the other two, namely His Prieſtly and Kingly are in the following Articles; for the whole of that Office being diſcharg'd in revealing to us the Goſpel, as the only Way and Method of attaining Salvation; and all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerning that being already couch'd in the Words, <hi>I Believe in Ieſus;</hi> or I Believe that Jeſus has reveal'd unto us the true way to Salvation, there's nothing needful to be farther expreſs'd upon that Head. But</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As to our Saviour's <hi>Prieſtly Office,</hi> there is not one Act which belongs to it, that is not particularly and diſtinctly taught you in the ſucceeding Articles of your Belief. His <hi>Prieſtly Office</hi> was to conſiſt in giving a Satisfaction, by way of Sacrifice and Attonement, for our Offences, and in going into Heaven, the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, with the Father in the Merit of that Sacrifice for the Forgiveneſs of our Sins. And now,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What belongs to his Sufferings, by way of Sacrifice, we are taught in theſe Words; <hi>He Suffered under Pontius Pilate, Was Crucified, Dead and Buried, He deſcended into Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. What pertain'd to his going into Heaven to incerceed for us there, we have deliver'd in theſe, <hi>The third day he roſe again from the Dead, He aſcended into Heaven, And ſitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty.</hi> Nor,</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:151517:261"/>3. Are the Nature and Acts of his <hi>Kingly Office</hi> leſs particularly and diſtinctly delivered in the Creed, than thoſe of his <hi>Prieſtly.</hi> One main Prerogative of that Royal Office, is, that from Heaven, <hi>He ſhall come again to judge both the Quick and the Dead;</hi> and all the remaining Articles declare the ſeveral other Parts of it. But theſe will alſo fall under another Conſideration, under which I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion them.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Then as to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the Third Perſon in the Bleſſed Trinity; to Him it does belong to prepare, qualifie, and ſanctifie with all neceſſary Vertues and Graces, all whom Chriſt has redeem'd and ſav'd from the Dominion of Sin and Satan, and cleans'd from the Pollution of their Natures caus'd thereby, <hi>that they may be meet to be Partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</hi> And this we are taught to believe that he does, in the Article, <hi>I Believe in the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> for the Attribute <hi>Holy</hi> does here import His doing this, His ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us. Thus does the Apoſtles Creed inſtruct us firſt in all the more material and weighty Truths neceſſary to be believ'd concerning God; And next, ſecondly, it does the ſame concerning the State and Condition of us Men, both in this and the World to come. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. In general, we are taught to Believe that all our Hopes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Happineſs on the Account of Chriſt's undertaking for us, depends upon our being Members of His <hi>Holy Catholick Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2dly, In particular it teaches us the great Privileges we enjoy through him, by being Members of the Church, both here and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; namely, that thereby we have the benefit of the <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> and the <hi>Forgiveneſs of Sins;</hi> and, that we ſhall have a <hi>Reſurrection of our Bodies to Life Everlaſting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus I have given you to underſtand what is meant by the <hi>Articles of our Belief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the word Rehearſe.</note> I am next to declare to you what is the Importance of the Word <hi>Rehearſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rehearſe the Articles of thy Belief.</hi> And,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This Word <hi>Rehearſe,</hi> poſſibly in its <hi>primary</hi> Deſign,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>1.</hi> It prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſignifies the Catechiſts Command to the Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to render him an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Faith.</note> may import no more than the Miniſters Command to thoſe that come to be Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chis'd, that they give him an Account of what they do <hi>Believe</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>God and his Church.</hi> And as <hi>the end of your Faith is the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of your Souls,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.9. So it is the Duty of ſuch as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Care, firſt to get as good an Underſtanding as they can in the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and then to give an Account thereof with all readineſs imaginable to us the Miniſters of Religion, whenever we demand it.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Apoſtle commands you to <hi>Obey them that have the Rule over you, and to ſubmit your ſelves, for they watch for your Souls, as they that muſt give an account, that they may do it with joy and not with grief,</hi> Heb. 13.17. And if the Paſtors of Chriſt's Church muſt give a ſtrict Account to God of your Proficiency in Faith and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it muſt be your Duty to make it appear to us, how much you
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:151517:262"/> have profited under us. And thus it lies upon you to do, that our Miniſtry may be eaſie and comfortable, and that we may have Joy and not Sorrow in the Execution of it. Alas, for us to be diſcouraged in the Exerciſe of our Miniſtry, is not for your Profit; for ſo long as we do it uncomfortably, we cannot do it ſo effectually as otherwiſe we might. <hi>To do it with grief, that it is unprofitable for you,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle in the ſame Verſe. And would to God you would believe it; But ſo it is, that there is nothing in the World would be a greater Satisfaction to us than to ſee you, as in the Jewiſh Church they did, <hi>ſit at the Feet of your Gamaliels,</hi> your Teachers; than to ſee you not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together cumbred with Worldly Buſineſs, as <hi>Martha</hi> was; but to attend on your Teachers with <hi>Mary, who choſe the better part,</hi> as our Saviour gave Teſtimony to her, becauſe ſhe diligently ſate to attend the Word delivered by our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.42.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>2.</hi> It may redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to all Worſhippers audibly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the Belief after the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.</note>2. This word <hi>Rehearſe,</hi> may be alſo <hi>reductively</hi> interpreted, as a Command of the Church, that whenever you come to worſhip God, you ſhould pronounce with an audible Voice the Articles of your Belief, together with your Miniſter, thereby pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, and before the whole Congregation, confeſſing that you are Chriſtians, and that you Believe all that Chriſtians ſhould Believe to their Souls Health; according to that uſual Form of Words uſed by ſome before their reciting of the <hi>Creed</hi> in Divine Service, calling upon the People to join with 'em in <hi>making Confeſſion of their Chriſtian Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it is order'd by our Church to very good purpoſe, that the whole Congregation ſhould bear a ſhare throughout the Common Service; and that all, both Miniſters and People, ſhould with united Hearts and Voices, utter God's Praiſes, and ſet forth his Glory in the Pſalms, and Hymns, and <hi>Creeds.</hi> And it is an admirable means to fix your Attention to the great Buſineſs you are about; that you are not to be ſtanders by, as it were, when God is glorify'd, but are perſonally to <hi>eccho</hi> forth his Praiſes. And it will alſo wonderfully ſtir up, and quicken each other in your Devotion to him, when you are ſtriving, as it were, which ſhall celebrate God's Goodneſs and Mercies with the mightieſt Vehemence and humbleſt Reverence. And as I do not doubt but it does enliven you in your Prayers to, and Praiſes of God, to have the Miniſter of Religion perform the Service with Seriouſneſs, and a becoming Devotion; ſo I muſt profeſs, that to ſee and hear ſome devout Worſhippers heartily to ſound forth their Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to God in the Congregation, has not a little enkindled a Flame in my own Breaſt; ſo that to <hi>rehearſe,</hi> and utter forth with an audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Voice the Glorious Excellencies of <hi>God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> in every one of the Pſalms and Hymns, is a thing very much becoming every Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>But eſpecially every one of you ſhould openly <hi>rehearſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs his Belief,</hi> together with the Miniſter, as often as we are called upon to it in Divine Service. We are to pray not only for Our ſelves but for Others; for we may be benefited not only by our own, but by others Prayers: But every one muſt <hi>Believe</hi> for himſelf, and ſhall be ſaved only by his own Faith; which is the reaſon that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our Publick Prayers are in the Plural Number, <hi>Our Father,</hi> our
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:151517:262"/> Belief runs in the ſingular, <hi>I' Believe;</hi> and therefore no Man, that owns himſelf a Chriſtian, ought to be ſilent when the Creed is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed</hi> in Divine Service; but every particular Perſon ought to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie his firm Belief and Aſſent to the ſame, by openly and ſolemnly rehearſing it together with Chriſt's Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>I ſay by <hi>openly and ſolemnly rehearſing</hi> it; for becauſe that this Body of Chriſtian Truths ought in the moſt open and <hi>ſolemn</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to be confeſs'd, our Church has appointed that the Creed ſhould not only be <hi>rehears'd</hi> and <hi>pronounc'd</hi> by every particular Member of the Congregation, ſo often as it occurs in Divine Service; but alſo that it ſhould be done <hi>ſtanding.</hi> 
                     <q>In the Creed,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Libertas Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſt.</hi> p. 458</note> we do profeſſedly (ſays the Learned <hi>Faulkner</hi>) acknowledge the Three Perſons in the Glorious Trinity to be the only true God, and our only Lord; and a ſtanding poſture well becometh a Servant in his profeſſed owning and attending upon his Maſter: We openly declare every one for himſelf, in the Words, <hi>I believe,</hi> the Ground of our Chriſtian Hope and Comfort, that in believing in the Father who made the World, and in the Son who Died and Roſe again, Aſcended, and ſhall judge all Men, and in the Holy Ghoſt, that we have Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Church of God, and the Communion of Saints, of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Forgiveneſs of Sins, a Reſurrection, and Everlaſting Life, and do alſo acknowledge all theſe Articles of the Chriſtian Faith: And a ſtanding Geſture is very ſuitable to any ſolemn Declaration of our Minds in Matters of moment and concernment. And as the open Profeſſion of Faith includeth a ſtedfaſt Reſolution to continue firm in the Acknowledgment of the Chriſtian Doctrine, this in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular is ſo properly ſignified by the ſtanding Geſture, that <hi>ſtanding to a thing,</hi> Deut. 25.28. and in ſeveral other Scriptures, ſignifies an aſſerting and profeſſing a thing with Reſolution;</q> ſo that you ought both openly, with an audible Voice, to <hi>Rehearſe</hi> your Belief after the Miniſter in Divine Service; And to ſignifie your ſtedfaſt Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſtick to your Faith, and to remain unſhaken in ſuch your Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, you ought to ſtand up when you ſo <hi>Rehearſe</hi> and Profeſs it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But yet farther,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>3.</hi> It may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely imply God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to all Chriſtians to confeſs him upon other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</note> This Word <hi>Rehearſe</hi> may be interpreted <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely</hi> to imply that other great Chriſtian Duty which may lye upon you; and that is frankly and openly to own the Belief and Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any, or all theſe Chriſtian Truths, when at any time there ſhall be <hi>occaſion</hi> given for ſuch a Declaration, tho' it may be to the hazard of your Lives, and the loſs of Goods, Livelihood, or all that is dear to you; or tho' you ſhall ſuffer the utmoſt Scorn, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of profane and wicked Men for ſuch your Belief and Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And the two great <hi>Occaſions</hi> for ſuch a Declaration are, when the Superiour Powers ſhall demand it, in order to perſecute you for the ſame; or when, through a general Indifference to Religion, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and wicked Men do take courage to run it down; and that the more, for the Cowardice of the Orthodox Profeſſors of it, as if afraid, or aſham'd to own it. But upon both theſe, or on any other occaſion, <hi>you muſt be ready always to give an Anſwer to every Man that asketh you a reaſon of the hope that is in you, with meekneſs and fear,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.15.</p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:151517:263"/>
                  <p>Firſt, Now as to the firſt of theſe Occaſions, the Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were often put upon this Duty of <hi>openly and publickly Confeſſing their Faith,</hi> when ſuch a Confeſſion was certain to bring upon them the ſevereſt Torments that the Malice of Men or Devils could inflict. For the then Princes of the World were Pagans, and Worſhippers of falſe Gods, who would often force the Chriſtians, either to <hi>Renounce</hi> their Belief in the one True God, the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and in Chriſt his only Begotten Son; or they would tear their Fleſh with burning Pincers, would throw 'em to be devoured by wild Beaſts, rend their Limbs aſunder on Racks, and put 'em to infinite other Tortures: But ſuch was the Conſtancy of thoſe Chriſtians, that they would not through Fear diſſemble their Faith, but would openly before the Heathen Tribunals declare their Belief of the True God, and of Jeſus Chriſt his only Begotten Son. And this their Declaration of their Chriſtian Faith, in the Language of the Scripture, and of the Ancient Church, was call'd a <hi>Confeſſing of Chriſt;</hi> and the Perſons that did ſo, were intituled with the Glorious Name of <hi>Confeſſors.</hi> And thus to confeſs Chriſt, by openly declaring your Belief in Him, and in God the Father, and God the Holy Ghoſt; and likewiſe your Belief in any other the <hi>Articles of the Chriſtian Faith,</hi> whatever ſhould be the danger in ſo doing, is expreſly made your Duty, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9.10. and has Salvation promis'd as the Reward of it. <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thine heart, that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved, for with the heart man believeth unto Righteouſneſs, and with the mouth confeſſion is made unto Salvation:</hi> Where you ſee that an open Confeſſion and Profeſſion of your Faith with the Mouth, is made as neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation as to Believe it in the heart.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A ſecond Occaſion for a frank and open owning of the Great Truths of Chriſtianity, is when through a general Indifference to Religion, impious and wicked Men do take Courage to run it down, and that the more for the Cowardice of the Orthodox Profeſſors of it, as if afraid, or aſham'd to own it. God be praiſed, it is not now made by the Powers that are above us in this Nation, a Matter worthy of Death or of Sufferings for any to own himſelf an Orthodox Believer; yet ſo many are the profane and ungodly Perſons, the Men of no Religion abroad in the World, that they will ſcoff at thoſe who ſeem to believe, and dare to own the Principles of Chriſtianity. And ſo few are thoſe who have the Courage to ſtand up in Vindication of the Truth (the Generality of Lay-Chriſtians, <hi>Gallio like,</hi> ſeeming to <hi>care for none of theſe things,</hi> and thinking it only the Clergy's Buſineſs <hi>to contend ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly for the Faith</hi>) that the Adverſaries to Religion are mightily embolden'd thereby to bear it down, deriding all ſerious Chriſtians and true Believers, as a Company of credulous and eaſie People, and applauding themſelves as the only <hi>Men of Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Free,</hi> becauſe Licentious, <hi>Thinkers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now whenever it ſhall be the Lot of any of you to fall amongſt ſuch who will ſcoff at you for believing, and profeſſing that you believe the Articles of the Faith, you muſt boldly oppoſe 'em, and let 'em know that you are not afraid, nor aſham'd <hi>of the Goſpel of Christ,</hi> nor to own your ſelves Chriſtians, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. And you muſt not through Fear, Baſhfulneſs, or Cowardice, diſſemble ſuch your
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:151517:263"/> Faith, leſt God, if you deny, or diſſemble your owning of him here, ſhould deny in the World to come his knowing of, or having any thing to do with you, as he declares he will, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.33. You ſee in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.70. how <hi>Peter</hi> being aſham'd of his perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Lord and Maſter, and afraid for himſelf, did deny his Saviour: But withal you ſee how ſeverely he ſmarted for it; for being prick'd at the heart with an extreme remorſe of Conſcience for ſuch a baſe piece of Cowardice, <hi>he went out, and wept bitterly,</hi> v. 75. And it was well he did, or elſe he had periſh'd everlaſtingly. So that to conclude, you muſt not only <hi>rehearſe,</hi> that is, give an Account of the Chriſtian Faith to us the Miniſters of Religion; and <hi>pronounce</hi> it amongſt thoſe who are Friends to it in the Houſe of God; but upon all juſt occaſions you muſt elſewhere, even in the Face of its greateſt Enemies openly declare and <hi>profeſs</hi> your Belief of thoſe great Chriſtian Truths, and that when you are ſure to ſuffer the ſevereſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions and Reproaches for ſo doing.</p>
                  <p>This laſt I muſt confeſs is not ſo directly the meaning of the Word <hi>Rehearſe</hi> in this place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if ever there were occaſion to extend the Importance of it to ſuch a Senſe, it is now, when the Confidence of Infidels in <hi>profeſſing</hi> their impious Principles, and the Cowardice of Believers in <hi>Confeſſing</hi> the True Articles of their Chriſtian Faith, is ſo extremely, and on both ſides ſo ſhamefully great.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have given you the utmoſt, that I conceive can be the Importance of theſe Words, <hi>Rehearſe the Articles of thy Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief;</hi> which may ſerve as a Prefatory Diſcourſe to the Expoſition I deſign, by God's Aſſiſtance, to make you of the Creed, upon the Explication of which I ſhall next enter.</p>

                  <head>THE XXIX. Lecture. <hi>I Believe.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>COmmenting upon theſe Words, <hi>Rehearſe the Articles of thy Belief,</hi> I have given you, by way of Preface to the Expoſition of the Creed it ſelf, an Account of its Authority; how that it is a ſummary Abridgment of the Chriſtian Doctrine, collected, as is highly probable, by the Apoſtles themſelves; however undoubtedly containing the moſt weighty and eſſential Points of Apoſtolical Doctrine that are neceſſary to be Believ'd in order to Salvation. And then as to the Importance of the Word <hi>Rehearſe,</hi> I have told you how neceſſary it is 1. that you ſhould give a good Account to God's Miniſters of what you <hi>Believe:</hi> 2. That you ought openly and ſolemnly to <hi>pronounce</hi> your Belief every time you meet together to worſhip God in the Publick Aſſembly: Nay, and, 3. That you muſt undauntedly <hi>confeſs,</hi> and own all theſe Chriſtian Truths before the Face of any Man, though you ſhould incur the greateſt Danger of Life, Livelihood, or whatever is moſt dear to you, or expoſe your ſelves to the Reproaches of wicked Men for ſo doing. And having thus by way of <hi>Preface</hi> to the Creed it ſelf, ſpoken what I thought neceſſary to its Authority, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion you are to make of it, I come now, by God's Aſſiſtance, to lay open before you the Meaning and Importance of every particular Truth therein contain'd.</p>
                  <p>And that which does firſt offer it ſelf to our Conſideration, and will indeed require a very large and full Explication, is the ſingle Word <hi>Believe.</hi> Every particular <hi>Article</hi> of the Creed, and every ſingle Truth (as there are many) contain'd in each Article, is to be Believed by us: It is therefore, I preſume, very requiſite that we ſhould with all poſſible Clearneſs and Exactneſs, explain the Nature of Faith, and ſhew you what it is to Believe to your Soul's Health, before we come to conſider the ſeveral Truths that are to be Believed accordingly.</p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:151517:264"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Belief</hi> are two Words that ſignifie the ſame thing;<note place="margin">Faith and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief ſynono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Terms.</note> and ſo indiſpenſable a Condition of our Juſtification and Salvation it is, to <hi>Believe,</hi> that not to mention more Texts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. <hi>It is ſaid a Man is juſtify'd by Faith:</hi> And, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. we are told in plain and expreſs Words, that <hi>he who Believeth ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> You muſt not therefore think me tedious, if in the Explication of this Point, I ſhall be ſomething large; ſince to <hi>Believe</hi> is a thing which you are not only to do in reference to every particular Article of our Creed; but that alſo as ever you will be juſtify'd and ſav'd. And for the more full Explication of this Point, I will do theſe Three Things.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>I will ſhew you in general what it is to Believe; together with the Effects and Fruits of True Believing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>I will more particularly explain unto you the Nature of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and Saving Faith. And then,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>By way of Inference, I will lay before you, wherein the Defect of ſeveral ſorts of Faith does lie, which we find by Scripture and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience that many do rely upon, but yet will by no means juſtifie and ſave 'em.</hi> And,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>I am to ſhew you in general, What it is to Believe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to Believe both in the proper and in the common Meaning of the Word, <hi>is to give Credit to the Report of another?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Faith is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon a credible Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</note> And herein it is diſtinguiſh'd from thoſe other Acts of the Mind, Opinion, Experience, and Knowledge; that <hi>Opinion</hi> is, when one varies in his Judgment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not without ſome doubt, whether the thing may not be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than he thinks; <hi>Experience</hi> is, when one's own Senſes tell one it is ſo and ſo; and <hi>Knowledge</hi> is, when I gather from undoubted Cauſes and Reaſons, that the Effect is thus. But <hi>Belief,</hi> as it is more certain than <hi>Opinion;</hi> ſo it is founded not upon my own Experience and Knowledge, but upon the <hi>Authority</hi> of ſome one elſe who does relate the thing to me.</p>
                  <p>It is indeed thought by ſome, that to <hi>Believe,</hi> in the Language of the Scriptures, which are the Words of plain Men, ſpoke to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bulk of Mankind, does many times ſignifie a full Perſwaſion of the Mind, whether wrought within us by the <hi>Evidence</hi> of the Matter, or by our own <hi>Senſe</hi> or <hi>Experience,</hi> or by ſome ſtrong <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Reaſon,</hi> as well as by ſome <hi>Credible Teſtimony;</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly we Believe God's Being and Exiſtence by the ſtrongeſt Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Reaſon; but yet however, tho' the Belief of God's Being be indeed a <hi>Knowledge</hi> that he Is; a Knowledge, I ſay, that we have from ſeveral demonſtrative Proofs and Reaſons, beſides what we have from the Teſtimony that he Himſelf has given us of his own Exiſtence; yet as the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> that he has given us by Miracles, Prophecies, and his Providences, are properly his Atteſtation to the Truth of the Article; ſo it is the neareſt and the plaineſt Proof thereof, and that upon which the Faith of the far greateſt part of Mankind (who do not much employ their Reaſon to ſearch after Truth) is founded; ſo that generally, as well as properly ſpeaking, <hi>to Believe is to give Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit upon the Authority and Teſtimony of another, that his Relation is true.</hi>

If it be only the Word of a mere Man which we have for the Truth of a thing, we are not to Believe it as that which is infallibly certain; for the wiſeſt and beſt of Men are inſufficient to give us ground to Believe 'em as infallible in what they deliver: The wiſeſt of Men may be ignorant of the exact Truth of Things, and ſo may be deceived themſelves; and thoſe that are not the beſt, nor very honeſt, tho' they do know what they ſay, yet may deceive others: So that the Credit we give to any Man living, can amount to no more than a <hi>Human Faith,</hi> ſuch as is fit to be given to Man; and we cannot Believe infallibly what an <hi>uninſpired</hi> Perſon ſhall ſay, as if it were impoſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe than he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.</p>

And this is to Believe in the Chriſtian Sence of the Word. <hi>It is to be undoubtedly perſwaded, upon the Divine Authority, of the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Truth and Certainty of whatever God has delivered and revealed to us in the Scriptures; particularly and eſpecially it is to be undoubtedly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the Infallible Certainty of thoſe main Truths of Scripture, the Articles of our Chriſtian Faith, wherein are declared the only Method of Reconciliation betwixt God and Man, through our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, as well as the ſtrongeſt Motives to a Holy Life: And laſtly, it is to be perſwaded of theſe things in ſuch a manner, and with ſuch Acts of the Mind, as is agreeable to the Nature of theſe ſeveral Truths.</hi>

There is nothing paſt, preſent, or to come; there is nothing in the Nature of Things that he does not moſt clearly know and apprehend; <hi>there is not any Creature that is not manifeſt in his ſight, but all things are naked and open before the eyes of him with
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:151517:265"/> whom we have to do,</hi> Heb. 4.13.

Nor is he <hi>Inſincere,</hi> and one that would delude us into a falſe Perſwaſion of Things: No; it is the <hi>Devil</hi> that is Inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, <hi>and the Father of Lyes,</hi> John 8.44. but <hi>it is impoſſible that God ſhould lye,</hi> Heb. 6.18. And to what end ſhould he deceive us, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us to Believe a Falſhood? What Intereſt can he ſerve by it? Our being deceived, can in no wiſe profit Him. Falſe and deceitful Men do indeed love to delude others to Believe Errors and Falſhoods, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make a Prey of 'em; but we can in no wiſe advantage God by our Miſperſwaſions.

                  </p>
                  <p>But this is a moſt <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>dangerous</hi> account of Divine Faith; <hi>Falſe,</hi> becauſe God has no-where in Scripture told any Man amongſt us, that he in particular is Juſtified, and ſhall be certainly Saved: And <hi>Dangerous</hi> alſo, becauſe it tends to nouriſh Preſumption in Men's Hearts, and to make 'em Believe better of their State than it is. God does indeed declare in his Word to all Men, in General and Conditional Terms, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. That <hi>whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved;</hi> and, That <hi>Bleſſed are they who keep his Commandments, that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:151517:266"/> they may have right to the Tree of Life,</hi> Rev. 22.14. And all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are to <hi>examine themſelves whether they be in the Faith, and to prove their own ſelves,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.5. and if upon ſtrict ſearch he finds himſelf to have Repented throughly, to have Believed practically, and to have Obey'd ſincerely, he may have ſtrong Hopes that his Sins are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd, and his Righteouſneſs through Chriſt accepted (only, becauſe <hi>the Heart is deceitful above all things, ſo that no Man knoweth it,</hi> Jer. 17.9. Let him be careful he does not deceive himſelf with falſe ſhews of Faith and Repentance; and <hi>let him that thinketh he ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, take heed leſt he fall,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.10.) But as for a <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> which is a full Perſwaſion founded upon the Teſtimony of God in Scripture, no Man can be ſaid to have that concerning his own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, becauſe no Man has any Scripture-Revelation teſtifying it to him in particular.</p>
                  <p>And if Perſons of <hi>Antinomian Principles</hi> ſhall ſay, that the Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance kindled in the Heart by the Spirit of God, is a Divine Teſtimony to them, and therefore may be ſufficient to denominate ſuch Aſſurance a <hi>Divine Faith;</hi> then it muſt be granted by 'em, that the written Word of God is not a ſufficient <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> as not containing all Truths neceſſary to be Believed in order to Salvation (amongſt which, they count this particular Aſſurance to be the chief) which Perſons of Proteſtant Principles will not own. Nor indeed can any ſo far dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the Perfection of Scripture, as to ſay, that other Truths are neceſſary to be Believed in order to Salvation, beſides what are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein, except it be ſuch who are not afraid of thoſe Words wherewith the Holy Canon is cloſed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18. <hi>If any Man ſhall add unto theſe things, God ſhall add unto him the Plagues of this Book.</hi> So that thoſe Revelations only which are contained in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, are the proper Object of a <hi>Divine Faith.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">But whatever is revealed in the Word, a Chriſtian muſt Believe.</note>And whatever is revealed in the Word, a Chriſtian muſt Believe as true, for the Authority of God who declar'd it ſuch. And in the Holy Writings are contain'd Declarations of Divers kinds; ſome of leſs, others of greateſt Conſequence, whereof the firſt need not to be ſo expreſly apprehended; but the latter muſt be both clearly Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and firmly Believed. A very great part of theſe Scripture-Truths of Conſequence to be Believed, are thoſe various Precepts of Holy Living, and Duties to God, our Neighbour, and our ſelves, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the Goſpel, as neceſſary to be diſcharged by us in order to Salvation. And it is as neceſſary an Act of Faith as any, to Believe that our ſincere Obedience to all the Divine Commandments, is an indiſpenſable Condition of Life and Happineſs. Again, in the Holy Scriptures, as we have Promiſes of ineſtimable Rewards, to thoſe who ſhall walk uprightly in the fear of God; and, on the other ſide, Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the ſevereſt Puniſhments, and that to all Eternity, to all ſuch as ſhall perſiſt in Rebelling againſt Him: So as to both theſe Promiſes and Threats, we are to be undoubtedly perſwaded of the Truth of 'em; and that God's Veracity and Sincerity, in the delivery therein, is ſuch, that not a tittle of either ſhall fail.</p>
                  <p>But ſince neither the Fear of God's Threatnings, nor the Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements of his Promiſes can prevail upon us in this our corrupt State to perform a <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>unſinning</hi> Obedience to all God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; ſo that the beſt of Men will be found Sinners before God,

                  <p>The Articles of our Creed do import (as has been already ſpoke, and ſhall hereafter, by God's Aſſiſtance, be fully explain'd and prov'd) this comfortable <hi>Scheme of Divine Truths; viz.</hi> That a God of infinite Perfection and moſt Glorious Attributes, did at firſt <hi>create</hi> and give us our Being; and that the ſame Almighty Father, has from the beginning, and will for ever exerciſe a Wiſe, Juſt, and Gracious <hi>Providence</hi> over all his Creatures; that Man the work of his hands, having rebell'd againſt his Maker, <hi>God the Father</hi> did in his wiſe and good Providence ſo order it, that His only <hi>Begotten Son</hi> taking our Nature upon him, and being <hi>God-Man,</hi> ſhould come into the World amongſt us, and afterwards return to <hi>our Father which is in Heaven,</hi> to mediate a Reconciliation betwixt him and us: And to the end his <hi>Mediation</hi> might be effectual to ſalve the Diſhonour done to God by our Revolt, and reduce us to our Allegiance and Obedience to him, that this Second Perſon in the Glorious Trinity did take upon him to diſcharge a Threefold Office; <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Prophet, Prieſt, and King:</hi> By the firſt whereof, he declar'd to us that Covenant, and thoſe Conditions on which God would receive us to Mercy: By the ſecond, that of <hi>Prieſt,</hi> he made way through the ſatisfaction he gave for the breach of our firſt Covenant, for the Divine Goodneſs to receive us to Favour, according to the Terms of the ſecond; and does ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceed with the Father for our Acceptance in the performance of ſuch Conditions: And by his <hi>Kingly Office</hi> he ſo governs by his Holy Spirit and Righteous Laws, thoſe who abandoning the Kingdom of Satan, are admitted into his Kingdom, the <hi>Holy Catholick Church,</hi> that they <hi>ſhall be made meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</hi> And in the Execution alſo of this his Royal Office, having by his Almighty Power rais'd all Men from the Dead, <hi>he will come again to judge 'em</hi> according to their Works, forgiving the Offences of thoſe who are penitent, and allotting them to an Everlaſting Life of Happineſs, and dooming the Impenitent to an endleſs Life of Miſery in another World.</p>
                  <p>This in few Words is the main ſcope and purport of thoſe great and fundamental Truths of our Religion, the Articles of our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith, as they relate to the Method of Reconciliation betwixt God and Man.</p>

                        <hi>2.</hi> The moſt powerful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Life.</note> And therefore to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly perſwaded of the infallible Truth and Certainty of theſe main Truths of Scripture, muſt in a peculiar manner be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon us. <hi>All Scripture is</hi> indeed <hi>given by Inſpiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs, that the Man of God may be perfect,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:151517:267"/> throughly furniſhed unto all good Works,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.17. That is, all the Parts of Scripture are more or leſs ſerviceable to our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore far indeed be it from a Chriſtian to entertain in his Breaſt a doubt of the Truth of any thing which God has reveal'd in his Word. However this undoubted Perſwaſion, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to conſtitute a true Believer, muſt in an eſpecial manner be had of the moſt important Truths; becauſe more does depend upon our having a ſtedfaſt and unwavering Belief of them than of others. The Belief of theſe is the very Foundation of the Chriſtian Life, and the diſtinguiſhing Character of a Diſciple of Chriſt; if therefore our Faith ſhould ſtagger as to theſe, upon every Temptation there will enſue a Fall, if not a <hi>Falling away,</hi> and a total Apoſtacy from the Chriſtian Religion. And therefore the Belief of theſe Articles concerning the Tranſaction between God the Father, and God the Son, with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Man, is made the great Condition of Man's Salvation. <hi>This is Life Eternal to know,</hi> that is to Believe <hi>Thee the only true GOD, and JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST whom thou haſt ſent,</hi> Joh. 17.3.</p>

                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>4.</hi> To Believe, is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of all Revealed Truths in ſuch manner, and with ſuch Acts of the Mind as is agreeable to the Nature of thoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Truths. <hi>1.</hi> It is firmly to aſſent with the Mind to all Scripture-Truths indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently.</note>4. And as to Believe, is to be undoubtedly perſwaded of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Truth and Certainty of Divine Revelations; <hi>ſo in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and with ſuch Acts of the Mind, as is agreeable to the Nature of thoſe ſeveral Revealed Truths.</hi> For why? The Nature of thoſe Things of whoſe Truth we are to be perſwaded, are very different; and therefore it muſt needs be, that the Acts of Mind which cannot but receive their ſtamp and modification from the Things Believed, muſt with reference thereunto, be accordingly various.</p>
                  <p>As, 1. There are ſeveral Truths contained in the Scriptures, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Old Teſtament; which however they concern'd the Jews whilſt their Religion was in force, are not of that great <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment</hi> to us Chriſtians: And therefore the Belief or Perſwaſion that may ſuffice us to have in reſpect of theſe, or the like, which are not of great Importance, is only a general firm Aſſent of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, whereby we yeild that theſe things are certainly ſo as God has declar'd, becauſe he who <hi>alone is True</hi> has ſpoke it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4. And indeed to all Scripture-Revelations indifferently conſidered, and of what kind ſoever they be, we muſt yeild a firm Aſſent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Authority of God declaring 'em to us.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>2.</hi> It is to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with the Will to live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably to the Importance of practical Truths.</note>2. But beſides ſome things of leſſer Moment, there are ſeveral Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of <hi>weighty Importance</hi> and <hi>Concernment</hi> to us Reveal'd in the Holy Writ, concerning which, it is not ſufficient that we only <hi>Aſſent</hi> unto 'em with our Minds that they are true, but it is moreover ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to give us the Title of True Believers, that in reference to ſuch <hi>Concerning Truths,</hi> we ſhould withal give up the <hi>Conſent</hi> of our Wills, to live as is fit for Perſons of ſuch Perſwaſions. Thus we are taught in the Goſpel, That God has ſent unto us his <hi>Onely Begotten Son,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare on what Covenants and Conditions he will receive us to Mercy: And that this ſame Jeſus will hereafter come as a <hi>King</hi> in all Pomp and Glory, to <hi>Judge both the Quick and the Dead,</hi> to paſs Sentence upon us either of Happineſs, or of Miſery, according as we have performed, or not performed, that gracious Covenant he has made with us. Theſe are ſome of thoſe weighty and important Truths contained in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and which in the Creed are particularly propoſed to our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; and theſe that we may be ſaid to <hi>Believe,</hi> and to be throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:151517:267"/> of the Truth of 'em, it is not ſufficient that we barely <hi>Aſſent,</hi> and yield that they are true, but we muſt <hi>Conſent</hi> with our whole Wills, that we will live and act as thoſe who are fully perſwaded of ſuch Truths. That is, if we are throughly perſwaded, that Jeſus Chriſt, by <hi>being Crucify'd, Dead, and Bury'd,</hi> has purchas'd Pardon for none other but thoſe, who abandoning their evil Ways, do in the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their Hearts endeavour to pleaſe him, we ſhall conſent to <hi>Obey God's Holy Will and Commandments, and to walk in the ſame all the Days of our Life.</hi> And again, if we are undoubtedly perſwaded, that he will finally <hi>come to Judge both the Quick and the Dead, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Works,</hi> we ſhall heartily <hi>Conſent</hi> to conform our ſelves in Thought, Word, and Deed, to his Holy Will and Pleaſure. To be undoubtedly perſwaded of ſuch Truths as theſe, which do ſo much <hi>concern us,</hi> does almoſt inſeparably carry in the Notion of it a <hi>Conſent of the Will</hi> to live as may be expected from ſuch as are perſwaded of the Truth of ſuch Things; and a bare <hi>Aſſent of the Mind</hi> that thoſe Things are ſo, will not be enough to give a Man the Title of a True Believer.</p>
                  <p>To Believe indeed in Propriety and Strictneſs of Speech, may ſeem to ſignifie an Act of the Intellect only aſſenting to the Truth of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: But in the Scripture, <hi>Believing</hi> is a more practical Word, and includes a Compliance of the Will with ſuch Practices and Courſes, as are conſequent upon ſuch Belief, if hearty and ſincere. And this is that which the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9, 10. calls a <hi>Believing with the Heart, for with the Heart Man believeth unto Righteouſneſs.</hi> And this was the Faith of thoſe mention'd <hi>Acts</hi> 11.21. of whom it is ſaid, That <hi>many Believed, and turned unto the Lord:</hi> Not to inſtance here in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Faith,</hi> of which I ſhall ſpeak hereafter. So that, in ſhort, the Scriptural Notion of Faith, or Belief, with reſpect to thoſe Practical Truths revealed to us in the Goſpel, is nothing elſe but a true, ſerious, reſolute embracing of Chriſtianity; not only a being perſwaded that all the Doctrines of Chriſt are true, but a conſenting and ſubmitting to his Will and Commands in all things: It is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and Accepting of Him as our <hi>Prophet</hi> to Inſtruct and Teach us, and as our <hi>King</hi> to Govern and Order us in the whole courſe of our Lives, as well as our <hi>Prieſt,</hi> on whoſe Satisfaction and Interceſſion we are to <hi>Rely</hi> for our Acceptance with God; which brings me to ſpeak of <hi>Reliance,</hi> a 3d Act of the Faith we are ſpeaking of. To proceed then,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Farther yet, there are very many of thoſe Chriſtian Truths,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>3s</hi> It is to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on Promiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Truths.</note> of whoſe Certainty we are to have a firm Belief and full Perſwaſion, which carry in them the Nature of moſt precious <hi>Promiſes</hi> of excellent Benefits, to be made good to us upon our Performance of ſuch and ſuch Conditions. And with reſpect to theſe, our Belief and Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is not only to be a <hi>bare Aſſent of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> that thoſe Promiſes are true; nor yet a <hi>meer Conſent of the Will only</hi> to Perform the Conditions upon which thoſe Promiſes are made; but there muſt be moreover a firm and ſteddy <hi>Reliance on God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> an Affiance and Truſt in Him that his Promiſes ſhall be made good to us on the Performance of the preſcribed Conditions. Such is the Belief of theſe Attributes of God, His Goodneſs and his Mercy, his Power and his Truth; to <hi>Believe,</hi> which is firmly to <hi>Relie</hi> upon him to help and reward us on the Performance of our Duty, as being a God that is wonderfully willing, and one that is equally able to do us
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:151517:268"/> good: Such again is the Belief, That <hi>Jeſus is the Chriſt,</hi> whom God the Father did ſend into the World to mediate a Reconciliation betwixt Himſelf and us; and whom, that there might be no Impediment on the ſcore of the Divine Juſtice and Holineſs, to his Receiving ſo Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious a Race as Mankind into Favour again, he therefore gave to <hi>offer Himſelf a Sacrifice,</hi> a Propitiation and Atonement in our ſtead, to <hi>Suffer under</hi> Pontius Pilate, <hi>to be Crucify'd, Dead and Buried,</hi> that we might be redeem'd from Death Eternal. To Believe, which is to depend ſolely upon Chriſt's Merits and Interceſſion, not on our own Righteouſneſs, that God the Father will, upon our ſincere Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, receive us to Mercy, tho' we have been the greateſt Sinners. And ſuch, laſtly, is the Belief of the <hi>Forgiveneſs of Sins, of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Body, and of the Life Everlaſting,</hi> which are Promiſes of ſo many good things to us, on condition we ſhall forſake our Sins, and ſincerely for the future obey the Goſpel. And to Believe theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, is to have a ſteadfaſt Confidence in God, that accordingly through Chriſt he will forgive us, Raiſe up our Bodies from the Grave at the laſt Day, and tranſlate us into Joys everlaſting, if we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and obey him.</p>
                  <p>We are not to <hi>Relie,</hi> nor to depend upon God's Mercies in Chriſt, Without our Repentance and new Obedience; for this were not to <hi>Believe,</hi> but to <hi>Preſume</hi> upon Him; for he never made any Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, no not through Chriſt, of accepting us without our Amendment and Reformation; but upon our Amendment and Reformation, we may undoubtedly <hi>Relie</hi> upon him, as one that is able, and one that is willing to fulfil his Promiſes to us.</p>
                  <p>And this Reliance on the Promiſes of God, is that Act of Faith which is called, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20. a <hi>not staggering at the Promiſe of God through <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief;</hi> and, <hi>v.</hi> 24. a <hi>Believing on God,</hi> a <hi>Believing in Chriſt,</hi> John 3.16. And ſuch a <hi>Reliance</hi> and Dependance upon God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Mercy, through the Merits of Chriſt his Son, appears in the Scriptures to be an Act of Faith more peculiarly well-pleaſing and acceptable unto him, in that it <hi>excludes Boasting,</hi> which the Apoſtle makes very neceſſary to Juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. and expects all Good from God's free Mercy in Chriſt, without any Reliance on the Merit of our own Performances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The genuine Fruits and Effects of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, are Victory over,</note>And thus having ſhew'd you in general, <hi>What it is to Believe, and in what Acts of the Mind it does conſist,</hi> it only remains, in order to compleat this Account of the <hi>Nature of Faith,</hi> which I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to give, that I ſpeak in a few Words of the <hi>Genuine Fruits and Effects of a True Christian Faith.</hi> The Tree is beſt known by its Fruits, and in like manner is Faith known by its Works, as St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.18. And ſurely from what has been ſaid, it will eaſily appear to you, that your Faith, if it be compleat in all the Parts of it, will undoubtedly produce a total Change in the Nature, and Diſpoſitions, and Actions of that Perſon who does firmly <hi>Believe the Great Articles of his Chriſtian Faith.</hi> A ſteady Perſwaſion of ſuch Concerning Truths, will not ſail in time to ſubdue all our Spiritual Enemies, the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, and all that mighty Hoſt of Temptations they will bring againſt us, to force or entice us from our Obedience to God.</p>

                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:151517:268"/>I. As to the World particularly, St. <hi>John</hi> does aſſure us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4.<note place="margin">

And by the World is meant both the <hi>Things</hi> and the <hi>Perſons</hi> of this World, that would entice us into Sin: The Things of this World are either Riches, Honours, and Pleaſures, (and they are commonly call'd the Good Things of the World,) and theſe would withdraw us from our Duty, to uſe unlawful means to compaſs 'em; or they are the contrary to theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Poverty, Diſgrace, and Afflictions, which are uſually ſtil'd the Evils of this World, and would force us to ſinful ways whereby to avoid 'em. And the Perſons that make up the <hi>Wicked World,</hi> are thoſe evil Men, who by their Examples, Society, Flatteries, Arguings, Kindneſſes or Promiſes, or by their evil Cuſtoms, would engage us in ſinful Compliances. The force of all theſe various Temptations from the World, I have already laid before you; and it is Faith we are here told in the Words of St. <hi>John</hi> now cited, whereby he who is <hi>born of God</hi> will be able to <hi>overcome</hi> this World, with all its Temptations. An undoubted Perſwaſion rooted in the Mind of the Certainty of thoſe Great and Powerful Truths of Chriſtianity already mention'd, will be able to pall and deaden our reliſh to theſe Pretended good Things of the World; ſo that we ſhall not immoderately affect nor indulge our ſelves in the Enjoyment of 'em; and the ſame full Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion alſo will moſt effectually baffle all the Inſinuations of wicked Men <hi>lying in wait to deceive us.</hi> Nor,</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:151517:269"/> Rulers of the Darkneſs of this World, againſt ſpiritual Wickedneſs in High Places.</hi> Wherefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> does warn us, <hi>to take unto us the whole Armour of God, that we may be able to withſtand in the evil day, and having done all, to ſtand: But above all to take the Shield of Faith, wherewith we ſhall be able to quench all the fiery Darts of the Devil.</hi> Eph. 6.11, 12. The Temptations and Aſſaults of the Devil, which the Apoſtle does here ſo ſolemnly rouze us up to reſiſt, are, I ſuppoſe, the terrible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions that Satan does in all Ages raiſe againſt one part or other of the Church; and theſe, tho' dreadful indeed, and moſt likely to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power us, yet are conquerable by a firm Faith, <hi>Looking unto Jeſus the Author and Finiſher of our Faith; who for the Joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the Shame, and is ſet down on the Right hand of the Throne of God: For if we conſider him that endured ſuch contradiction of Sinners against himſelf, we ſhall not be weary, nor faint in our Minds,</hi> Heb. 12.2, 3.</p>
                  <p>So that, in ſhort, the true and genuine Effects of Faith, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and perpetual Victories againſt the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, and an univerſal Obedience, notwithſtanding any of 'em, to the Commands of God. And therefore ſince ſo much depends upon a true Faith, that <hi>he who believeth ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Mark 16.16. <hi>And by the Grace of God we are ſaved through Faith,</hi> Eph. 2.5. It does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely concern you to <hi>examine your ſelves whether ye be in the Faith, and to prove your ſelves,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.5. And the only way to prove the Sincerity of your Faith, is by examining the fore-mention'd Fruits of it in your own Lives and Converſations, and by ſeeing whether it produces a good Life. For this we may aſſure our ſelves, having the Authority of an Apoſtle for it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.26. That <hi>as the Body without the Spirit is dead; ſo Faith without Works is dead alſo.</hi> So that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept upon examination you ſhall find your ſpiritual Enemies in a great meaſure ſubdu'd, and an Habit of Vertue rooted in your Souls, your Faith is not ſincere.</p>

                  <p>But our Comfort and Happineſs is this, That the Firſt Covenant which exacted from us an unſinning Obedience,<note place="margin">The Firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant now cancell'd.</note> is now cancell'd, and we have been admitted, in our Baptiſm, into a <hi>Covenant of Grace;</hi> wherein a hearty and ſincere Conformity to the Terms of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, that is, a <hi>practical Believing</hi> of thoſe Great Doctrines of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſumm'd up in our <hi>Creed,</hi>

And the reaſon the ſame Apoſtle oppoſes this to his <hi>own Righteouſneſs, which is of the Law,</hi> is becauſe of the manifeſt difference betwixt the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Legal Righteouſneſs exacted by the Law, and this Evangelical ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in the Goſpel.</p>

So that though the Beſt Man living does not perhaps keep any one of God's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in a Legal ſence; yet the meaneſt ſincere Chriſtian keeps 'em all in an Evangelical ſence, that is, in ſincerity of Reſolution and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour.</p>
                  <p>And in this ſence, Good Men are in Scripture ſaid to <hi>keep God's Charge, his Commandments, his Statutes, and his Laws.</hi> As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it is ſaid of <hi>Zacharias, and his Wife Elizabeth, that they were both Righteous before God, walking in all the Commandments and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Lord blameleſs,</hi> Luke 1.6.

                     <hi>And now Juſtification is God's Adjudging thoſe to be thus Righteous, who have performed the Conditions of the Second Covenant;</hi> that is, who have Believed practically, Obey'd ſincerely, and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted heartily. To be Juſtified is not to be <hi>made</hi> Juſt and Righteous; Perſons are made ſo by Sanctification: But in Juſtification, they are approved of by God as ſuch, and adjudged to be ſo; and this who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever conſiders the Scope of thoſe Places of Scripture where this Word is us'd, will find to be the Importance of it, and that it is a Law-Term, and almoſt always us'd in a Judicial ſence, and particularly that it is the Act of a Judge acquitting a Perſon from Guilt and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in oppoſition to the condemning him in either. In this ſence it is us'd, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.15. <hi>He that Juſtifieth the Wicked, and he that Condemneth the Juſt, even they both are an Abomination to the Lord:</hi> Where to <hi>Justifie the Wicked,</hi> is to Acquit him of Fault, or Guilt; as, on the contrary, to <hi>Condemn the Juſt,</hi> is to paſs Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt him as a Wicked Perſon.

'Tis certain that God hath Acquitted them.</p>
                  <p>And according to this Sence of the Word, we ſhall in abundance of places ſind, that good, ſincere, and faithful Perſons, are ſaid to be <hi>Juſtified,</hi> that is, Approved of by God as Juſt and Righteous, or ſuch as have performed their Covenant with him. To this ſence it is ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11. that <hi>the Publican went down to his Houſe Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> that is, Approved of by God.

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That any the moſt Righteous and Juſt Men, are, upon a practical Faith, a ſincere Obedience, and an unſeigned Repentance, thus <hi>Approved and Adjudged by God as Juſt and Righteous Perſons, is through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or by virtue of his Mediation with the Father, that we ſhould be Accepted upon ſuch Terms, and that our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould be meaſured according to the Rules of the Goſpel. For Man having broke his Covenant with God, and become ſo depraved in all the Faculties and Powers of his Nature, that he could no longer live up to the ſtrictneſs of it, then did the Son of God mediate with the Father for a diſannulling of all former Covenants impoſſible to be perform'd, and for the ſubſtituting of a more gracious Covenant in their room: For which reaſon, it is ſaid, That <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law, being made a Curſe for us,</hi> Gal. 3.13. And that he <hi>Blotted out the Hand-writting of Ordinances that was againſt us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his Croſs,</hi> Col. 2.14. and that <hi>He is the Mediator of a Better Covenant,</hi> Heb. 8.6. In ſhort, the Caſe is this:</p>
                  <p>All Mankind having Rebell'd againſt God, and by their Breach of Covenant with Him, made it impoſſible for 'em to be Juſtify'd by that <hi>Original Law of Righteouſneſs,</hi> which requir'd an Unſinning Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and whilſt <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſtified,</hi> they muſt of neceſſity be in a <hi>State of Damnation;</hi> that, to the Honour of God's Government, his Juſtice might be ſatisfied for the Violation of his Laws; and yet that we might be reinſtated in a Capacity of being Juſtified and Sav'd by virtue of a more <hi>Gracious Covenant</hi> conſiſting of Terms and Conditions perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable by us; our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt did Satisfie for our Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and, moreover, Purchaſe with the Price of his Moſt PRECIOUS BLOOD, ſuch Terms and Conditions for us, as, by His Grace and Aſſiſtance we might be able to perform; and upon ſuch Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, God being always ready to Approve of us, and to Judge us as having Obey'd his Goſpel; Therefore it muſt be, that <hi>through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> it is, that God does accordingly Juſtifie and Adjudge us as Righteous Perſons.</p>
                  <p>And therefore in this ſence it is true, and none other, that <hi>Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is imputed to us.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chriſt's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us no otherwiſe than in its Effects and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</note> It is not poſſible that his Perſonal Righteouſneſs ſhould be imputed to us as ours, ſo that we ſhall be look'd upon as having perfectly kept the Law in him; an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that has no Foundation in Scripture, is abſurd in Reaſon, and is dangerous with reſpect to Practice, it being a very great Temptation to Perſons to ceaſe their Endeavours to be inherently Righteous them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (which at beſt cannot be but in imperfect degrees) when they are perſwaded that they ſhall be accounted ſuch, by having the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted Righteouſneſs of Chriſt thus imputed to 'em: <hi>But let no Man deceive you</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>John) he that doth Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is Righteous, as he is Righteous,</hi> 1 John 3.7. Yet however, <hi>the Righteouſneſs of Christ is imputed to us in its Effects and Conſequences;</hi> for by his fulfilling the <hi>Law of Mediation,</hi> and thoſe Conditions concluded upon betwixt Him and the Father, in which conſiſted his <hi>Mediatorial Righteouſneſs,</hi> he procur'd and purchas'd for us that Ineſtimable Favour, that our imperfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:151517:271"/> ſuch as we by his Grace are enabled to perform, according to the Terms of the Goſpel, ſhould be <hi>accepted</hi> to our Juſtification; and thereupon that we ſhould be Approved as Juſt, and ſhould ſtand <hi>recti in Curia,</hi> according to Evangelical Terms, the Goſpel Rules and Meaſures of Righteouſneſs. Thus <hi>all having ſinned, and come ſhort of the Glory of God, we are Juſtified freely by his Grace, through the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that is in Jeſus Christ; whom God hath ſet forth to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our Sins, through Faith in his Blood, to declare his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs for the Remiſſion of Sins that are past, through the Forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God,</hi> Rom. 3.23, 24, 25. That is, all Mankind, both Jews and Gentiles, being found Sinners, neither Juſtification nor Salvation could be had for 'em, according to the Terms of the Firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: Whenſoever therefore any are <hi>Juſtify'd,</hi> it muſt be freely by the undeſerved Favour of God, through the Great Work which Jeſus Chriſt hath wrought for the Redemption of Man, accepting of their imperfect Righteouſneſs, inſtead of an unſinning Obedience, and pardoning their Sins through the ſame Chriſt. Which brings me to the laſt Particular to be accounted for, in my Deſcription of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but makes it unneceſſary to add much more explication of it: And that is this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>5.</hi> Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Penitents from the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of all thoſe Sins, of which according to the Terms of any precee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, there was Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> 
                     <hi>That Juſtification is an Acquitting of all ſincere Penitents from the Puniſhment of thoſe Sins, of which according to the Terms of any former Covenant, there was no place for Pardon.</hi> By what has been already ſaid, you ſee that the Firſt Covenant, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd a Righteouſneſs not performable by us in our fallen State, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>cancell'd</hi> through Chriſt, there is place for Repentance in this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace. And as under this, our Repentance is a great part of our Evangelical Righteouſneſs; ſo the <hi>Acquitting</hi> us upon our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance from the Puniſhment of our Sins, is a great part of <hi>God's Juſtification of us through our Saviour Chriſt.</hi> And that God's Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of us from the Puniſhment of thoſe Sins we have Repented of, is one Notion of a Chriſtian's Juſtification, appears from that eminent Place, Acts 13.38, 39. <hi>Be it known unto you, Brethren, that through this Man is preached unto you the Forgiveneſs of Sins; and by him all that Believe are Juſtify'd from all things, from which ye could not be Juſtify'd by the Law of</hi> Moſes. In which words, as it is evident that the Goſpel of Chriſt allows Pardon upon our Repentance, for thoſe Sins, for which the Firſt Covenant, that of <hi>Moſes</hi> (and much leſs that made with <hi>Adam</hi>) allow'd no Mercy: So it is alſo manifeſt from hence, that the Juſtification which is now declar'd from Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in God's pardoning ſuch Sins, Acquitting the Penitent Believer that now comes into the Obedience of Chriſt, whatſoever his paſt Sins have been.</p>
                  <p>And this part of Juſtification, the <hi>Pardoning of our Sins,</hi> is that which the Apoſtle means, by not Imputing of our Sins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.7, 8. <hi>Bleſſed are they whoſe Iniquities are Forgiven, and whoſe Sins are Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Bleſſed is the Man unto whom the Lord will not impute Sin.</hi> In which place he who conſiders the drift and force of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, will eaſily perceive, that <hi>Juſtification, Forgiveneſs of Sins, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of Sin,</hi> and <hi>not Imputing of Sin,</hi> are equivalent Phraſes, and ſignifie the ſame thing.</p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:151517:272"/>
                  <p>And thus at length I think I have fully and ſufficiently declar'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the meaning of Juſtification. And from what has been ſaid, it does appear, that <hi>to the Praiſe and Glory of his Grace, he hath made us acceptable in the Beloved, in whom we have Redemption through his Blood, the Forgiveneſs of Sins, according to the Riches of his Grace,</hi> Eph. 1.6, 7. That is, from what has been ſaid in the Explication of this Point of Juſtification, it is manifeſt, that as it conſiſts <hi>in God's Adjudging of us as Righteous, according to the Terms of the Second Covenant; and in his Acquitting of us from the Puniſhment of ſuch Sins, as would not be pardon'd under any other:</hi> So the Favour of being thus Juſtify'd by God in both its parts, is owing to the <hi>Mediation of his Beloved Son, our Saviour Chriſt, in whom he is ſo well pleaſed,</hi> as to be <hi>pleaſed</hi> alſo with us upon his Account. And thus having given you the full meaning of Juſtification,</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>I am now to ſhew you by what Faith it is, that we are accordingly Juſtify'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>2.</hi> By what Faith we are accordingly Juſtified.</note>By what has been ſaid, as it does appear that Juſtification is a <hi>Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Act</hi> of God Adjudging us as Juſt and Righteous, according to the Terms and Conditions of the Second Covenant; ſo likewiſe that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Obedience are no leſs neceſſary in the Goſpel-Covenant than Faith it ſelf is, to render us Evangelically Juſt and Righteous; and therefore when our Juſtification is by Scripture, in ſo peculiar a manner attributed to Faith, it cannot but be of mighty Importance rightly to underſtand what that Faith is by which we ſhall be approved by God as Juſt and Righteous.</p>
                  <p>And in order to this, I muſt here premiſe, That nothing is more uſual in Scripture-Language, than to attribute the whole Rewards of a Chriſtian Life, to any one of thoſe Conditions of Chriſtianity, which by the great Influence they have upon other Parts of Religion, may be ſaid to imply all the reſt. Thus for inſtance, <hi>the Mercy of God is promiſed to be from everlaſting to everlaſting, upon them that Fear him,</hi> Pſal. 103.17. The Reaſon is, becauſe <hi>Fear</hi> is ſuch an active Principle in us, that no one who really fears God, but immediately ſeeks out all ways, and betakes himſelf to all Courſes to obtain his Favour. So again, <hi>Bleſſed is the Man that maketh the Lord his Truſt,</hi> Pſal. 40.4. The reaſon is, becauſe no Man can reaſonably truſt in God for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his Promiſe, but he muſt perform thoſe Conditions upon which ſuch Promiſes are made to him; and the greater are his Hopes in God's Goodneſs and Truth for the making good his Promiſes, the greater will be his Care and Diligence in ſuch ways in which alone he can with reaſon Truſt and Hope in Him. And not to mention more, even Life eternal is promis'd to the Knowledge of God and Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>This is Life eternal, to Know Thee the only True God and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, whom thou haſt ſent,</hi> John 3.17. And why ſhall the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God entitle any one to eternal Life? Shall this be excluſive of Repentance and Obedience? No, by no means, but as produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of 'em, and indeed including 'em; for it cannot eaſily be imagin'd, but that he who throughly knows the Nature and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God, and the Wiſe and Great Methods he has taken to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover Mankind from their loſt State, and to reconcile 'em to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:151517:272"/> by his Son; it cannot eaſily be imagin'd, I ſay, but that lie who thoroughly knows theſe things, muſt betake, himſelf to ſuch Courſes, as will Reconcile both himſelf to God, and God to him: And he who ſeriouſly conſiders what he thus knows, will undoubtedly take this Care.</p>
                  <p>And now this being premis'd,<note place="margin">By a Faith that is perfect and compleat, as to all thoſe Acts before-mention'd.</note> the like Obſervation may be made of the Promiſes of Juſtification and Salvation made to Faith or Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. and in many other places. Theſe great and precious Promiſes are made to Faith, as productive of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Obedience, and indeed as including them; for in Jeſus Chriſt, or in the Chriſtian Religion, or under the Chriſtian Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>nothing availeth any thing but Faith, which worketh by Love,</hi> or which is perfected <hi>by Love,</hi> Gal. 5.6. So that the Faith or Belief by which alone we ſhall be Juſtified and Sav'd, muſt be perfect and compleat, as to all thoſe Acts before mention'd; that is, it muſt be ſo through a Perſwaſion of the Infallible Truth and Certainty of whatever God has reveal'd to us in the Holy Scriptures, as thereby we muſt not only <hi>Aſſent with our Minds,</hi> that all theſe Great Things are true, which are revealed to us in the Goſpel, and <hi>ſumm'd up in our Creed,</hi> but we muſt alſo heartily yield up the <hi>Conſent of our Wills,</hi> of our Affections, and of the whole Man, to be Govern'd in our whole Life and Converſation, by thoſe Great Truths and Doctrines. And farther yet, it muſt be a firm and ſteddy <hi>Reliance</hi> upon God, that all his precious Promiſes of Pardon and Happineſs ſhall be fully made good to us through Chriſt's Mediation, upon our performing of the Conditions, on which ſuch this Promiſes were made. Such a Faith as this, through the Mediation of Chriſt obtaining that Benefit of God for us, ſhall be accepted; ſo that they who do ſo Believe, ſhall be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified and ſaved; but that Faith which is ſhort of this, is but maimed and imperfect; it is but either the <hi>Faith of Devils,</hi> mentioned by St. <hi>James,</hi> 2.19. or the <hi>Faith of Hypocrites,</hi> or in ſome reſpects or other defective; and ſo ſhall not avail us to Juſtification or Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>And this will fully appear to us,<note place="margin">This exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd in the Faith of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> who</note> if we conſider the <hi>Faith of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> what it was, concerning which we find ſeveral times in Scripture, as, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.22. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.23. this Honourable mention, That <hi>it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him for Righteouſneſs:</hi> For ſuch as was <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, the <hi>Father of us all,</hi> Rom. 4.16. Such muſt be our Faith, if we will be the <hi>Children of</hi> Abraham, and <hi>be bleſſed with Faithful Abraham,</hi> Gal. 3.7.9. And as to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith,</p>
                  <p>The firſt great Act of it we find mentioned in the Scripture,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>1.</hi> Conſented to the moſt difficult Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances at God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</note> was his readily leaving, at God's Command, <hi>his own Country, and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Houſe, and his going into a Country that God ſhould ſhew him, Gen.</hi> 12.1, 2.

                        <hi>2.</hi> Rely'd firmly upon God's Promiſes, in full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his Power and Goodneſs to perform 'em.</note>A ſecond Act of that Faith which was <hi>imputed to Abraham for Righteouſneſs,</hi> was his ſteddy <hi>Reliance,</hi> Truſt, and Confidence in the Promiſes of God, of granting him a numerous Offspring, even after that, in all human appearance, it was impoſſible for him and <hi>Sarah</hi> to have Children: Yet <hi>he againſt Hope, believed in Hope, that be might become the Father of many Nations: And being not weak in Faith, he conſidered not his own Body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old; neither yet the deadneſs of</hi> Sarah<hi>'s Womb: He ſtagger'd not at the Promiſe through <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief, but was ſtrong in Faith, giving Glory to God: And being fully perſwaded, that what he promiſed, he was able alſo to perform, therefore it was imputed to him for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs:</hi> That is, this ſteadfaſt Faith and Reliance of his upon the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Promiſes, was a ſign of the good Opinion he had of God's Power and Fidelity, and was therefore moſt graciouſly accepted by him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18, 19, 20, 21, 22.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now this,</hi> as the Apoſtle goes on, v. 23, 24, 25. <hi>was not written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him; but for us alſo, to whom it ſhall be imputed, if we Believe on Him who raiſed up Jeſus our Lord from the dead; who was delivered for our Offences, and was raiſed again for our Juſtification:</hi> That is, in this Act of Faith alſo, in a <hi>ſteddy Reliance</hi> upon the Promiſes of God, was <hi>Abraham</hi> a Pattern to us whereby we may ſee, that if we diſtruſt not his Power and Goodneſs in Matters of the greateſt difficulty, but firmly <hi>Relie</hi> upon him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Doubt or Diſpute, this will render us acceptable to him. But eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially it will be a moſt acceptable Act of Faith in us wholly to <hi>Relie</hi> upon his Promiſes in Chriſt (who became a Sacrifice for our Sins,) that all our moſt heinous Offences will be pardon'd, if we unfeignedly Repent, and our imperfect Obedience will be eternally rewarded, if it be but ſincere; in Teſtimony and Aſſurance of which Promiſes, God has raiſed our Saviour from the dead.</p>
                  <p>And thus you plainly ſee what ſort of Faith, or Believing, it is, that muſt now Juſtifie and Save us. It muſt not be only giving up the <hi>Aſſent</hi> of our Minds, that all that God has ſpoken is true, but we muſt with all our Hearts <hi>Conſent</hi> to a ſincere and faithful Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to all his Commands, ſuch as may be expected from thoſe who are undoubtedly perſwaded of the Truth of all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, which are every one of 'em Doctrines very apt to move us to Holy Living. And moreover, it muſt be a firm <hi>Reliance</hi> on God's Truth, that all his Promiſes ſhall certainly be made good to us, on Condition of our Performances. Eſpecially, as the caſe now ſtands with us Chriſtians, it muſt be an <hi>Entire Dependance upon Chriſt,</hi> that through his Mediation with the Father on our account, we ſhall be Juſtify'd, Pardon'd, and Sav'd, on Condition we perform the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, that is, Believe, and ſincerely Obey the Commands of God given us in the Goſpel.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Reliance upon God's Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Pardon to us through Chriſt, an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Act of Faith incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon us, as the caſe now ſtands with us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</note>
                     <hi>I ſay, as the caſe now ſtands with us Chriſtians;</hi> for all Mankind, by reaſon of <hi>Adam</hi>'s and our own Tranſgreſſions, were liable to the Wrath of God, and had been condemn'd to eternal Deſtruction, had not Jeſus Chriſt interpos'd betwixt his Father and us, and Mediated with him, that we might have Pardon and Happineſs, on Condition we would turn from our evil Ways, and ſincerely Obey him for the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:151517:273"/> future; ſo that <hi>through the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt it is, that we have Redemption and the Forgiveneſs of Sins, according to the Riches of his Grace,</hi> Eph. 1.7. And as <hi>in him are given unto us exceeding great and precious Promiſes,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. ſo <hi>all the Promiſes of God in him are Tea, and in him Amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20. That is, upon the account of Chriſt, all his Promiſes of eternal Life and Happineſs, ſhall be certainly and infallibly made good to us, on condition we forſake our Sins, and obey him. And yet <hi>when we have done all things which are commanded us, we are to account our ſelves but unprofitable Servants, having done no more than was our Duty to do,</hi> Luke 17.10. And we cannot lay claim to thoſe unſpeakable Rewards laid up for his Obedient Servants, meerly upon our own Deſerts, as if we had merited and deſerved 'em; <hi>but that no Fleſh might Glory in his Preſence, it is Jeſus Christ who is made unto us Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs, and Sanctification and Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. That is, it is Jeſus Chriſt who is the cauſe of our Juſtification and Sanctification; and by the Merit of what he has done for us, ſhall our imperfect Righteouſneſs be ſo accepted of by God, that we ſhall be unſpeakably rewarded for it.</p>
                  <p>And if ſo; if all our holy Performances ſhall be Accepted and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded only through Chriſt, it is on Him then, and not on any thing that we have done our ſelves, that we muſt depend, and <hi>Relie for Pardon and Happineſs.</hi> For without his Merits to ſupply our Defects, our beſt Performances will want Pardon, and all that we can do will not merit nor deſerve eternal Life and Glory. Thus we muſt <hi>Believe,</hi> that is, Relie on Chriſt, and <hi>we ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting Life,</hi> John 3.16.</p>
                  <p>And indeed this Reliance and Dependance upon God for Mercy,<note place="margin">Becauſe it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in our own Merits, and Boaſting in our own Performances</note> on the account of what Chriſt has Merited for us, not on the account of any Deſerts of our own, appears in the Scriptures, as I before ſaid, to be an Act of Faith more well-pleaſing to God, and acceptable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, in that it <hi>excludes Boaſting,</hi> or Glorying in our own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs (which the Apoſtle makes very neceſſary to Juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.) and expects the Reward meerly from God's Free Mercy in Chriſt, without any Reliance upon our own Performances: For, as it is <hi>verſ.</hi> 23, 24, 25, 26. <hi>All have ſinned, and come ſhort of the Glory of God, being Justified freely by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus, whom God hath ſet forth to be a Propitiation through Faith in his Blood, to declare his Rightoouſneſs that he might be Juſt, and the Juſtifier of Him that Believeth in Jeſus. Where is Boasting then? It is excluded? By what Law? The Law of Works? Nay, but by the Law of Faith; therefore we conclude a Man is Juſtify'd by Faith, without the Deeds of the Law.</hi> Which brings me,</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>To ſhew you in what ſence we are ſaid to be Juſtify'd by Faith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>3.</hi> In what ſence we are ſaid by S. <hi>Paul</hi> to be Juſtified by Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Deeds of the Law.</note> 
                     <hi>without the Deeds of the Law.</hi> Both this Text of the <hi>Romans</hi> now mentioned, and that Parallel place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. ſeem to exclude Good Works from being at all neceſſary to our Juſtification. And yet by what has been already ſaid from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> it does appear, that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Obedience, are Conditions equally requiſite to our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with Faith: Or when Faith alone is mentioned, it is as inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the other two; and St. <hi>James</hi> alſo does moſt expreſly aſſert, that <hi>by Works a Man is Juſtified, and not by Faith only,</hi> Jam. 2.24. So
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:151517:274"/> that to clear the Holy Scripture from any Contradiction, in this caſe, it will be requiſite to conſider what St. <hi>Paul</hi> means by the <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>by the Deeds of the Law,</hi> when he excludes either from having any thing to do in our Juſtification; and what that Faith is, upon which he does ſometimes ſeem to lay the whole ſtreſs in that great Affair.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">By Law in St. <hi>Pual</hi>'s diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the Jews, was meant both the Law of Nature, and the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     </note>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> diſputing with the <hi>Jews</hi> about the Invalidity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of any other Diſpenſation, or Law, to render us Juſt and Accepted by God, beſides the Goſpel; and the Neceſſity for all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that will be Juſtify'd and Sav'd, to Believe and embrace the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as the only means of both: By Law he underſtood both the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> and the <hi>Law of</hi> Moſes; according to either of which, if they would ſtand a Judgment, he ſhews it was not poſſible for any to be Juſtified, or accounted as Juſt; becauſe there was no Man living but had tranſgreſs'd and violated thoſe Laws, and fallen ſhort of thoſe Conditions preſcrib'd in 'em, according to which a Man was to be accounted Juſt and Righteous. <hi>He had prov'd before, both Jews and Gentiles, that they were all under Sin; and that therefore by the Deeds of the Law, there ſhall no Fleſh be Juſtified in his ſight,</hi> Rom. 3.9, 20. So that the whole of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning, when he denies Juſtification to be by the Law, is this, That according to the perfect Rule of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs preſcribed to <hi>Adam,</hi> or by <hi>Moſes,</hi> no Man now in this our fallen State, can be accounted, reputed, or <hi>Adjudged Righteous.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">By Works and Deeds of the Law, are meant both Moral and Ceremonial Duties, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without Faith, and as meritorious of the Reward.</note>Nor can any be Juſtified by the <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Deeds of the Law</hi> for another reaſon; for by <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Deeds of the Law</hi> in the <hi>Jews</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thoſe Words in that Diſpute St. <hi>Paul</hi> had with 'em, were meant the obſervance of the Moral and Ceremonial Works and Duties of the Law, as performed by their own Natural Strength, without the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Aſſiſtance of God's Grace, and not conſider'd as flowing from Faith; and, moreover, theſe Works and Deeds of the Law they accounted as <hi>meritorious</hi> of the Reward, they were <hi>Works upon which the Reward would have been reckon'd, not of Grace, but of Debt,</hi> Rom. 4.4. and which would have given occaſion for <hi>Boaſting,</hi> v. 27.</p>
                  <p>And now this being the meaning of the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Deeds and Works of the Law,</hi> in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Diſpute with the <hi>Jews;</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> Doctrine being this, That by obſervation of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> they could approve themſelves as Juſt and Righteous before God, and by the <hi>Deeds and Works of the Law,</hi> perform'd by their own Natural ſtrength, they could <hi>merit</hi> the rewards of Obeying, and could have good reaſon to <hi>Boast</hi> of their Righteouſneſs, which the Phariſees amongſt 'em were ſo apt to do,<note place="margin">In oppoſition to which ſence of the Law and Works, St. <hi>Paul</hi> does plead Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to be attainable on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon Goſpel Terms.</note> as we ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11.

That therefore <hi>we are Juſtified freely by God's Grace, through the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that is in Jeſus Chriſt, whom God hath ſet forth to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation through Faith in his Blood, to declare his Righteouſneſs that he might be Juſt, and the Juſtifier of him that Believeth in Jeſus,</hi> v. 24, 25, 26. That is, Chriſt has reveal'd this way of Juſtifying Sinners; namely, that he will accept and reward all thoſe as Righteous Perſons, who ſhall Believe and embrace thoſe Terms of Salvation propos'd in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:151517:274"/> the Goſpel, and ſhall accordingly give themſelves up to be rul'd by it.</p>
                  <p>And this is to be <hi>Juſtified freely by his Grace,</hi>

                     <hi>and occaſion of Boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting:</hi> For when all is done, our Repentance, Faith, and Obedience, hath nothing of Virtue, or Merit, of Natural or Moral Efficiency in it, towards the purchaſing of the Pardon of our paſt Sins, and to render us Righteous, were it not for his Mercy in Chriſt, in giving us ſuch gracious Laws and Terms of Righteouſneſs, as thoſe contained in the Goſpel.

                  <p>And by what hath been ſaid in the Explication of this Part,<note place="margin">And from the ſame account it will eaſily appear how S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>James</hi> may be Reconciled.</note> I hope it does alſo ſufficiently appear, that there is no real oppoſition between St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>James,</hi> when the former does aſſert, That <hi>a Man is Juſtified by Faith without the Deeds of the Law;</hi> and the latter, That <hi>by Works a Man is Juſtified, and not by Faith only.</hi> For it is not, you ſee, the ſame Law, nor the ſame Works, upon which their Diſcourſes proceeded; but quite different, both Laws and Works; and therefore there could be no Contradiction between 'em.<note place="margin">The Works and Deeds of the Law by which S. <hi>Paul</hi> denies we can be Juſtified, are either an unſinning O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or the Obſervance of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Laws. The Works by which, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to S. <hi>James,</hi> we ſhall be Juſtified, are the Works preſcribed by the Laws of the Goſpel flowing from Faith. The occaſion alſo of theſe Diſcourſes, was different.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Law St. <hi>Paul</hi> excludes from being a Rule of Juſtification, was both the <hi>perfect Law of Nature,</hi> and the <hi>Law of</hi> Moſes; and the <hi>Deeds and Works of the Law,</hi> which he likewiſe excludes from being the Terms on which God will Juſtifie us, were a perfect, exact, unſinning Obedience, ſuch as is requir'd by the Original Law of Righteouſneſs, or an Obſervance of all the Laws of <hi>Moſes.</hi> By neither of which Laws, nor the Deeds and Works of ſuch Laws, could we at all be Juſtified; ſince according to thoſe Rules of Righteouſneſs, <hi>Curſed is every one that continues not in all things to do 'em,</hi> Gal. 3.10.</p>
                  <p>But the Works St. <hi>James,</hi> c. 2.24. ſeems ſo carefully to intereſs in the Affair of our Juſtification, jointly and equally with Faith, are thoſe Works preſcribed by the Laws of the Goſpel, proceeding from, and produced by Faith, or Works by which our Faith is demonſtrated, to be a true and real Faith, <hi>c.</hi> 2.18.</p>
                  <p>And the occaſion of theſe Diſcourſes of St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>James</hi> was different, which alſo was the reaſon they did ſo differently expreſs themſelves in this matter. St. <hi>Paul</hi> had to deal with Jews, Phariſees, and falſe Teachers, who pleaded the neceſſity of Obſerving the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and alſo thoſe Works and Deeds it preſcrib'd, which gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:151517:275"/> to him to preach the Abrogation or Cancelling of that Law,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Paul</hi> having to deal with Phariſaical Jews, boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law.</note> and the ſubſtitution of the Goſpel in its ſtead, as a Rule of Righteouſneſs; the Believing of which, in ſuch a manner as has been ſpoke, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared would be ſufficient through God's Mercy in Chriſt to their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. And tho' he took all care that was requiſite to prevent the miſunderſtanding of him, as if a meer Opinionative Faith would ſerve the turn, by aſſuring them at the ſame time, he told 'em, that <hi>in Chriſt neither Circumciſion, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion would avail any thing;</hi> yet that <hi>Faith which worketh by Love, would, Gal</hi> 5.6. That is, that it muſt be ſuch a Faith as muſt be made perfect by the addition of thoſe Duties which we owe to God and our Neighbour; yet <hi>Men of corrupt Minds, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate concerning the Faith,</hi> or void of Judgment concerning the Faith, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> complains of ſome, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8. perverted his meaning in this his excellent Doctrine, and turn'd all to this ſence, That a meer <hi>Aſſent of the Mind</hi> to the Truth of the Goſpel, tho' they were careleſs in the ſubduing of their Paſſions, and bridling of their Tongues, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating of their Actions,<note place="margin">S. <hi>James</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to do with <hi>Solifidiant</hi> Libertines pleading their Faith, ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> was all that was neceſſary to their <hi>Juſtification.</hi> And thereupon they thought themſelves ſafe upon the Account of their Barren Faith, though they were Proud, and Conceited of their Knowledge and Attainments, Cenſorious and Contentious, Unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and Uncharitable; which Error concerning Faith prevailing much in thoſe Early Times, occaſion'd St. <hi>James</hi> with a great deal of Earneſtneſs to plead, and to prove the Neceſſity of Good Works to our being juſtify'd before God; And that neither Faith, nor good Works <hi>alone,</hi> but both <hi>jointly</hi> were the Condition now under the Goſpel, upon which we ſhall be juſtify'd, and approved of by God, as Juſt and Righteous Perſons. And he proves it by the Inſtance of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.21, 22, and 23. <hi>Was not Abraham our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther juſtify'd by Works, when he had offer'd his Son Iſaac upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar? See'ſt thou how Faith wrought with his Works, and by Works his Faith was made perfect. And the Scripture was fulfill'd, which ſaith Abraham Believed God, and it was imputed to him for Righteouſneſs, and he was called the Friend of God.</hi> So that St. <hi>James</hi>'s Doctrine of Juſtification is not a contradiction, but a vindication of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s from the Falſe Gloſſes of <hi>Solifidian</hi> Libertines.</p>
                  <p>And it were happy for theſe latter Ages, if St. <hi>James</hi>'s Doctrine concerning the neceſſary <hi>Conjunction of Faith and good Works</hi> to our Juſtification, could have put a ſtop to Men's Miſ-interpretations of the other Great Apoſtle in this Point. But alas, to the grievous Scandal of the Reformation, too many amongſt us have heretofore, and do to this day earneſtly contend for thoſe Miſtakes; which our Adverſaries make great Advantages of, who greedily catching at any thing of Error profeſs'd by any Party of Men under the Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Proteſtants, are never backward to lay the Scandal of it to the whole Reformation, to the very great hindrance of its Progreſs.</p>
                  <p>But above all, the Miſchief of this Opinion reacheth <hi>directly</hi> to the Deſtruction of Men's Souls; whilſt being deceiv'd in the Nature of <hi>Juſtifying Faith,</hi> and thinking it to be a meer <hi>Aſſent of the Mind</hi> to the Great Truths of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> which is but the Act only of one Faculty of the Soul; and not looking upon it as implying a <hi>Conſent alſo of the Will</hi> to act agreeably to the Nature of ſuch practical Truths, they do moſt fatally preſume themſelves to be Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:151517:275"/> and ſuch as ſhall be ſaved by Chriſt, tho' their Lives declare them to be far from being <hi>New Creatures,</hi> from <hi>being renewed in the Spirit of their Minds, as thoſe are, who have been taught as the Truth is in Jeſus,</hi> Eph. 4, 21, 23.</p>
                  <p>And therefore ſince ſo much depends upon a right Underſtanding of this great Doctrine of <hi>Juſtifying Faith,</hi> it will not appear to you to be without Reaſon, that I have been ſo large in the Explication thereof.

                        <hi>5.</hi> The Faith of Hypocrites.</note>Laſtly, Another ſort of Faith which will not Juſtifie nor Save us, may be ſtiled the <hi>Faith of Hypocrites;</hi> and this is the Faith of ſuch who expect to be Juſtified and Sav'd <hi>meerly for Believing,</hi> or rather for <hi>Relying</hi> and <hi>Recumbing upon Chriſt,</hi> without performing the other Conditions of Repentance and Obedience, which are the neceſſary Effects, or Ingredients rather, of Juſtifying and Saving Faith; and without which, it is not our Believing alone which will at all avail us. Of this ſort were many among the Jews of old, of whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets do often complain, that looking upon themſelves as a <hi>Choſen Nation,</hi> as a peculiar People whom God had Elected out of all the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:151517:276"/> Nations of the Earth to beſtow his Favours upon,<note place="margin">Such was the Faith of many among the Jews, preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that they were a choſen People.</note> they would confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently lean and depend upon him, that he would aſſuredly be their God, and that they ſhould be his People, notwithſtanding that they gave themſelves up to work all Unrighteouſneſs, and were cruel Extortioners, Oppreſſors, and the like. Thus, <hi>Micah</hi> 3.9, 11. <hi>They abhor Judgment, and pervert Equity; yet they will lean upon the Lord, and ſay, Is not the Lord among us? None Evil can come upon us.</hi> And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> complains, that tho' they <hi>would ſwear falſly by the Name of the Lord;</hi> yet they had the Confidence to <hi>call themſelves the Holy City, and to ſtay themſelves upon the God of Iſrael,</hi> Iſai. 48.1, 2.</p>
                  <p>And, there are too many alſo amongſt us Chriſtians,<note place="margin">And ſuch is the Faith alſo of many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming likewiſe that they are the Elect.</note> who confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently preſuming that they are the <hi>Elect Children of GOD,</hi> do undoubtedly hope for all that Pardon and Happineſs, which Chriſt with the Price of his moſt Precious BLOOD hoth obtained for us, meerly upon the account of their firmly Believing that Chriſt hath done all for 'em; and if they can but Believe this, they fondly perſwade themſelves they ſhall certainly be Juſtify'd, let them be never ſo Wicked and Diſobedient to God's moſt Righteous Laws; yea, tho' they are Proud, Boaſters, Covetous, Envious, and Bitter Revilers of thoſe who are much better than themſelves. And in this their wholly depending upon Chriſt, without any Good in themſelves, they think they ſhall moſt Honour Chriſt, and ſet forth the Greatneſs of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of us, whereas to preach the neceſſity of our own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, tho' wrought by his Grace, and accompany'd with many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, were to teach Men to depend (as they fooliſhly enough imagine) not upon the Merits of Chriſt, but their own Deſerts, which are none at all, and ſo would derogate from, and leſſen the Grace of Chriſt, and the Greatneſs of that Redemption he hath wrought for us. And this ſort of Faith or Dependence upon Chriſt alone, as thoſe before mention'd, <hi>Micah</hi> 3.11. and <hi>Iſai.</hi> 48.1, 2. So our Chriſtian Hypocrites like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, call <hi>Leaning upon the Lord,</hi> and caſting themſelves upon the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a <hi>Leaning</hi> and <hi>Rolling</hi> themſelves upon the Promiſes of Chriſt for Salvation.</p>
                  <p>But for any to expect to be Juſtify'd and Accepted by God, without forſaking their evil Ways, and without <hi>working out alſo their own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with fear and trembling;</hi> that is, without being extreamly careful themſelves to be Obedient to God's moſt Holy Laws, is groſs Hypocriſie, and will miſerably deceive us. Hypocriſie is with vain Shews and Pretences to deceive our ſelves or others; and to be only <hi>Hearers,</hi> or Believers, <hi>of the Word, and not Doers, is to deceive our ſelves,</hi> St.<hi>James</hi> tells us, 1. 22. And a greater than he, even our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf hath aſſured us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.21. That <hi>not everyone who ſaith unto him, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but he that doth the Will of his Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as for the Pretence they have to live ſecurely in unrepented Habits of Sin, that the Grace and Mercy of Chriſt is more Magnify'd, the greater Sinners they are; I anſwer, That the greater Sinners they <hi>have been,</hi> the greater is the Mercy which Forgives 'em, when they do repent, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20, 21. <hi>Where Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded, Grace did much more abound; that as Sin hath reigned unto Death, even ſo might Grace reign through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> But to make the <hi>Magnifying of God's Grace</hi> a Reaſon for Security, whilſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:151517:277"/> Men continue in Sin; this indeed was a falſe Concluſion, that ſome in the Firſt Times, as well as now, were apt to draw from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine of Juſtification, but which that Great Apoſtle rejected with the utmoſt Indignation and Abhorrence in the next Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? Shall we continue in Sin, that Grace may abound? God forbid? How ſhall we that are dead to Sin, live any longer therein?</hi> No ſure, the Doctrine of Chriſtianity, tho' it lays aſide the Original Law of Righteouſneſs, and the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> from being either of 'em a Rule of Righteouſneſs, in conforming to which we ſhall be Juſtify'd; yet this Doctrine moſt ſtrictly obliges us to a ſincere Reformation from all former Sins, and to a Newneſs of Life, as the indiſpenſible Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being Juſtify'd by God. Nor is there the leaſt occaſion given us by this Doctrine, to value our ſelves upon our own Righteous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, when it is only of Grace that we are able to do any thing which is good, and the Acceptance of the Good we do, is owing to the Mediation of Chriſt, who obtained ſuch Gracious Terms and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Juſtification for us: Which Conſiderations, as I have already made appear, do ſufficiently ſhew that we are <hi>Juſtify'd freely by God's Grace in Christ,</hi> and do exclude all Grounds and Occaſion of <hi>Boaſting.</hi>

                  <p>I Have already ſhew'd you what it is to <hi>Believe,</hi> that our Faith muſt be ſuch as rectifies and renews our Corrupt Nature, as moves us to the performance of the moſt difficult Inſtances of Chriſtian Duty; and ſuch as after all cauſes us to relie ſolely upon the Mercies of God in Chriſt, for the Acceptance of our imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience to our Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>And now by the Divine Aſſiſtance, I ſhall proceed to explain unto you all thoſe ſacred Truths contain'd in your Creed, which are of ſuch mighty Importance. And there are not a few ſuch powerful and practical Truths imply'd in this one Article, <hi>I Believe in God the Father Almighty Maker of Heaven and Earth.</hi> Towards the full Explication of which, that it may effectually work a bleſſed Change both in our Hearts and Lives, I will do theſe Things.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God's Nature and Attributes highly neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</note>The Knowledge of God, as it is the moſt Noble Knowledge in reſpect of the Object, whoſe tranſcendent Excellencies deſerve our moſt inward and retired Thoughts, and can never be ſufficiently meditated upon by us; ſo it is the moſt uſeful Knowledge in the whole World; for there is no Attribute in the Divine Nature, but being underſtood, does teach ſome Vertue or other; and all of 'em do neceſſarily create in the Minds of thoſe who do conſider them, the higheſt Veneration, Love, and Honour towards that Being which does poſſeſs 'em.</p>
                  <p>The Truth of it is, to the want of a due Knowledge of the Divine Nature and Attributes, and to Men's Miſapprehenſions concerning 'em; to this, for the moſt part, are owing all thoſe higher Enormities which the more degenerate Race of Sinners do commit, as Atheiſm, Superſtition, and whatever other unrepented Habits of Sin. The ſhort-ſighted Atheiſt does not behold God as the Firſt Cauſe of All Things, and the Fountain of all thoſe Perfections which are found in the Creatures, and therefore he does as <hi>Ignorantly,</hi> as <hi>Impiouſly</hi> deny his Being: On the other ſide, the <hi>Superſtitious Religioniſt</hi> does look upon him as a Moroſe and Arbitrary, a Humourſome and Captious Power; and therefore does ſtudy to flatter him with ſervile Rites and Obſervances, inſtead of paying him a <hi>Reaſonable Service,</hi> ſuch as the Scripture does preſcribe And on the contrary, the looſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine frames his Notions of God, as of one that is wholly made up of Mercy, to the Impeachment of his Juſtice and Holineſs, and to the utter diſanulling the Truth of all his Fearful Threatnings; and thereupon does live ſecurely in thoſe Habits of Sin, in which he has long indulg'd himſelf, and that without Thoughts of repenting of 'em; ſo miſchievous are the Effects of Ignorance and Error con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Divine Nature.</p>
                  <p>But beſides, and above all, it is to be conſider'd, that the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Nature and Attributes of God is of ſuch mighty Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that it is made the great Condition of Life and Happineſs: <hi>This is Life Eternal to know Thee the only true God,</hi> Joh. 17.3. As well it may, ſince there is no entring therein, 'till we are conform'd to the Image of God; but how can we imitate that Nature, and thoſe Perfections, which we have little or no Knowledge of. Not that the Divine Nature can be known to Perfection. It is one Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:151517:278"/> thereof, that it is <hi>Incomprehenſible.</hi> But ſo far as God has Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd himſelf to us in the Holy Scripture; ſo far we may ſafely enough declare that we know him. And contenting my ſelf with thoſe accounts which we may be able to derive from thence concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; I ſhall adventure to give this very imperfect Deſcription of God. Namely,</p>
                  <p>

                  <p n="1">I. I ſay, <hi>God is a SELF-EXISTENT BEING.</hi>

But as it is impoſſible that God ſhou'd ever heretofore not have been, ſo it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible he ſhould ever hereafter ceaſe to be. And this is ſaid both by <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to be the importance of the word <hi>Jehovah,</hi> by which he would be diſtinguiſhed from the Crew of Pagan Gods. They either had no Being but in the fancy of their Worſhippers, or elſe were but meer Creatures Deified by the Superſtition of Men; but the God whom we ſerve, is, and ever was the ſame from all Eternity, and therefore does give that ſtrange account of himſelf, when <hi>Moſes</hi> would needs know by what Name he ſhould ſet him forth to the People, <hi>I am that I am, thus ſhalt thou ſay unto the Children of Iſrael, I am hath ſent me unto you,</hi> Exod. 3.14.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. And as he is neceſſarily Exiſtent,<note place="margin">

And being whatever Perfection is found in the Effect, muſt needs be eminently greater in the efficient Cauſe that produc'd it, it muſt therefore follow, that conſidering thoſe manifold and vaſt Perfections which are found in all the Creatures from the loweſt to to the higheſt, God who Created all theſe, and gave 'em theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Perfections, muſt be himſelf infinitely Perfect; ſuch Reaſon had <hi>Zophar</hi> in <hi>Job</hi> 11.7. to cry out, <hi>Canſt thou by ſearching find out God, canſt thou find out the Almighty unto Perfection?</hi> Which brings me,</p>

                  <p>Nor does it at all argue Fickleneſs or Inconſtancy in the Decrees and Purpoſes of God, that he is ſometimes ſaid to <hi>Repent,</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.6. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.11. <hi>Repentance</hi> indeed as it is found in Men, argues unſteadineſs; for it ariſes from the conſideration of having done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, with a deſign to amend; and it proceous either from <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Imprudence,</hi> when a Perſon finds that Matters have not happen'd out as he imagin'd, or from <hi>Impotence,</hi> when he has begun a thing which he cannot finiſh; or out of <hi>Inconſtancy,</hi> when a Man diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves what he did formerly like well of.

The truth of it is, with reſpect to thoſe very Actions, upon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of which God is ſaid to Repent, there is really the greateſt Conſtancy in the Decrees and Purpoſes of God, which are to ſave all Believing and Penitent Perſons, and to cut off Unbelievers and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitents. And tho' the Perſons who are threaten'd to be cut off, ſhould afterwards be Sav'd, this ſhews indeed an Alteration in thoſe Perſons who have changed from worſe to better, and ſo prevented God's Anger; but it ſpeaks no Variation in God himſelf, who is ever fixt to his own Rule of <hi>Rewarding every Man according to his Works;</hi> ſo that the Reſult is this, that <hi>with God there is no variableneſs, nor ſhadow of turning,</hi> James 1.17.</p>

                     <hi>He is tranſcendently Good in his own Nature,</hi> inſomuch that in compariſon of him none of his Creatures can be termed <hi>Good.

                  </p>
                  <p>He neither wills nor acts any thing but what is agreeable to the higheſt Reaſon.

But far be it from any pious Mind to conceive thus unworthily of God. He will be found indeed to inflict the moſt diſmal and terrible Puniſhments upon both Devils and wicked Men; but that will be upon ſuch juſtifiable Reaſons, as will leave even the

But to clear the Divine Juſtice of any Hardſhip, contrary to Reaſon and Equity, in this, it muſt be conſider'd, that theſe <hi>Everlaſting Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> are <hi>Legal Penalties,</hi> which the Great Law-Giver does inflict for the Violation of his Laws: And if all wiſe Law-givers, who will preſerve the Authority of their Government and Edicts, find it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to inflict ſometimes ſeverer Penalties for leſſer Crimes in their own Nature; and indeed be the Offence what it will, ſuch as are ſufficient to deter Offenders from the Violation of their Laws, and to ſecure their Government over their Subjects: The Infliction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Eternal Puniſhments are no more than Neceſſary and Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, ſince as great as they are (conſidering the Allurements to Sin are preſent, and conſequently more tempting, and theſe Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments apprehended at a great diſtance) they are found little enough to reſtrain obſtinate and perverſe Sinners from perſevering in Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. In ſhort, all thoſe Kinds, Meaſures, and Degrees of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are Juſt, Equitable, and Reaſonable; which are no more than neceſſary to preſerve the Authority of Government, and the Sacredneſs of its Law: And thus may the Juſtice of God be fairly accounted for, as rewarding no otherwiſe than according to Men's Works, tho' he inflicts upon 'em for their Temporary Tranſgreſſions, Eternal Puniſhments.</p>
